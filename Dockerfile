# Single image for the whole monorepo. Each Railway service runs the
# same image with a different start command. Locally:
# `docker compose up --build` runs all three via compose.yaml.
#
# No build step for JS. webjs serves .ts directly by stripping types at the
# runtime layer (position-preserving whitespace replacement, no sourcemap shipped
# to the browser). webjs is buildless end to end; there is NO bundler or esbuild
# fallback.
#
# The image carries BOTH runtimes by design. The BUILD toolchain runs on Node
# (npm install, the core dist bundle, Tailwind), which keeps
# the proven buildless toolchain unchanged; **Node 24+ is REQUIRED** there (the
# built-in `module.stripTypeScriptTypes` stripper and recursive fs.watch need it),
# which is why the base pins a current Node major. The SERVING process runs on
# Bun: each service's start command is `bun ... webjs.js start`, so `startServer`
# selects the native `Bun.serve` listener shell (more req/s on the listening path)
# and strips `.ts` via `amaro`. The one behavioral difference from the node:http
# shell is that 103 Early Hints are node-only (Bun.serve has no informational-
# response API), so the modulepreload head-start is dropped on Bun; the preloads
# still ship in the document head. The Bun binary is copied from the official
# `oven/bun` image below; nothing is BUILT on Bun, so there is no build-toolchain
# risk.
#
# Tailwind CSS IS built at image time (CLI, no browser runtime). The
# blog applies its Drizzle migrations (`webjs db migrate`) at start via
# `webjs.start.before`; there is no DB codegen step.

# --- 3. Build-time work --------------------------------------------------
# Core: build the dist/ bundles. The package.json `prepare` hook is a
# self-guarded no-op during step 1 (manifests-only npm install, before
# scripts/ and packages/core/src/ are copied in), so the bundle has to
# be built explicitly here, after sources land. Without this step,
# production images serve per-file from src/ via the workspace-dev
# fallback, which is functional but waterfalls the browser through ~15
# requests per page instead of one chunk per subpath.
RUN npm run build:dist --workspace=@webjsdev/core

# Blog: no DB codegen step. Drizzle has no generated client (the schema IS the
# types). The committed migrations are applied at container START by the blog's
# `webjs.start.before` (`webjs db migrate`), not at build time.

# UI registry: the registry JSON is composed on demand by the route handlers
# (no build step). But the ui-website's component DETAIL pages statically import
# the component SOURCES from `components/ui/*.ts`, which the `prestart` hook
# generates by copying them out of packages/ui/packages/registry/. A start
# command that serves directly (the `bun webjs.js start` form, which bypasses
# npm `prestart`, the same way the Tailwind step below is needed) would 500 on
# every component page without these files, so bake them at build time here.
# `copy-registry.js` is pure filesystem (no runtime / network / DB), so it is
# build-safe.
RUN cd packages/ui/packages/website && node scripts/copy-registry.js

# Tailwind: compile per-app CSS (all four use the CLI, no browser runtime).
# Each compose service's command invokes `webjs.js start` directly, which
# bypasses the per-package `prestart: css:build` hook in npm; the CSS has
# to be ready in the image. Keep this list in sync with the apps that
# have a public/input.css and a `css:build` script in their package.json.

# Docker-based platforms, so the readiness gate works the same everywhere
# without a per-platform file. Each service sets its own PORT (compose env, or
# Railway injects it); the probe reads it, defaulting to 8080. Dependency-free
# (Node's built-in fetch, no curl/wget). Platforms that read their own config
# point the equivalent knob at the same path (Railway healthcheckPath in
# railway.json, Fly [checks], k8s readinessProbe).
