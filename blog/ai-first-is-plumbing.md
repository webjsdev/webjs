You have probably watched an AI coding agent produce something that looks right and is quietly wrong: a broken convention, a config it could not have known about, code dropped in the wrong place. "AI-first framework" is the label everyone reaches for as the cure, and most of the time it means nothing at all.

When I say WebJs is AI-first, I do not mean it has an AI-generated landing page or a chat widget on the docs. I mean a list of dull operational decisions, each of which makes the difference between an agent that writes correct code on the first try and one that produces a plausible-looking file in the wrong directory.

Here is the actual list, ordered roughly by how much each thing pays back.

# AGENTS.md (and its siblings)

Every scaffolded WebJs app (the starter project `webjs create` generates for you) ships with these files at the root:

```
AGENTS.md                                  agent contract (this is the load-bearing one)
CLAUDE.md                                  Claude Code import file (points at AGENTS.md)
.agents/rules/workflow.md                  Antigravity (Google) workspace rules
.github/pull_request_template.md           PR template (also AI-readable)
.editorconfig                              text-tool consistency
```

The trick is that all of them say the same thing, and that there are fewer of them than there used to be. AGENTS.md is the source of truth. CLAUDE.md is just `@AGENTS.md` (Claude Code's import syntax), and it is the only bridge file left, because Cursor, opencode, Antigravity, and the Copilot coding agent all read AGENTS.md natively now. The PR template carries the convention checklist into every code review.

Most agents read whichever file matches their tool first. AGENTS.md is the cross-tool standard ([emerging spec, FYI](https://agents.md/)). Every WebJs scaffold ships it.

Concretely, the AGENTS.md file is short: a brief of a couple of hundred words saying that routing follows the Next.js App Router, components use Lit's APIs from `@webjsdev/core`, light DOM is the default, TypeScript must be erasable, and server code lives in `*.server.ts`, followed by the commands to run after each edit. It used to be around 40k characters of file conventions, API tables, invariants and recipes. The last section says why most of that is gone.

# The pre-commit hook

The hook (in `.hooks/pre-commit`, distributed via the scaffold) does three things:

1. Blocks commits to `main` / `master`. Forces a feature branch + PR.
2. Runs `npm test`. Refuses commits that break the suite.
3. Auto-generates `changelog/<pkg>/<version>.md` when a `packages/<pkg>/package.json` version bumps. (Yes, the framework itself ships its changelog this way. Yes, the scaffolded apps inherit the pattern.)

The hook is enforced via `git config core.hooksPath .hooks`. Scaffolded apps have it set automatically on `webjs create`. The framework's own repo uses the same hook.

What this gets us is that an agent in autonomous mode (running with permission to commit) cannot accidentally commit broken code to main. The hook fails, the agent reads the error, the agent fixes the test. The discipline is enforced in the tooling layer, not in a prompt.

# The convention validator

`webjs check` runs a set of lint rules over the project. A few real ones:

- `no-server-import-in-browser-module`: a module that genuinely ships to the browser does not import a server-only file, whose client stub throws at load
- `use-server-needs-extension`: a `'use server'` directive requires a `.server.{js,ts}` filename
- `reactive-props-no-class-field`: a reactive property is never also a class field, which would replace its accessor and stop the re-renders
- `erasable-typescript-only`: `tsconfig.json` has `erasableSyntaxOnly: true`
- `shell-in-non-root-layout`: non-root layouts and pages don't write `<!doctype>` / `<html>` / `<head>` / `<body>`
- `no-server-env-in-components`: `process.env.X` in components only reads `WEBJS_PUBLIC_*` or `NODE_ENV`

Each rule lives in `packages/server/src/check.js`. The agent runs `webjs check` before committing, sees violations as concrete messages, and fixes them.

The lint is intentionally narrow. Every rule catches something that is wrong to ship, a crash, a leaked secret, a reactive prop that silently stops re-rendering, or source that will not strip, and the framework does not lint style preferences. `webjs check --rules` prints the current set, which is the only place worth reading it from, because a list copied into a blog post goes stale the next time a rule lands.

# Hooks beyond pre-commit

`webjs create` also scaffolds:

- `.claude/hooks/block-prose-punctuation.sh` (blocks em-dashes, pause-semicolons, and other patterns that come from training data but don't fit our docs)
- `.claude/hooks/guard-branch-context.sh` (intercepts Edit/Write when the agent is on main, forces a feature branch)
- `.claude/hooks/nudge-uncommitted.sh` (reminds the agent to commit when uncommitted-file count crosses a threshold)
- `.claude/hooks/require-tests-with-src.sh` (warns when source is staged with no test beside it)
- `.claude/hooks/check-server-imports.sh` (catches a server-only import reaching a module that ships to the browser)

Each hook is a small shell script. They fire on the agent's tool-call events. They are advisory for everything except the branch-guard, which actively blocks edits when on main.

These are Claude-only, and that is now a deliberate choice rather than an accident of what got written first. The scaffold used to carry the same nudge logic in Gemini, Cursor, and opencode formats too. Keeping four copies of one rule in four config dialects turned out to cost more than it bought, so the scaffold dropped them and kept the two enforcement layers that bind every agent regardless of tool: the pre-commit hook above, and CI.

# WEBJS_PUBLIC_* environment shim

This is a tiny detail but it pays for itself constantly. Variables named `WEBJS_PUBLIC_*` (matching the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` convention) get injected into the browser as `window.process.env.WEBJS_PUBLIC_X`. The shim is one inline `<script>` in the SSR (server-rendered HTML) head.

Why this is AI-first: the agent reading the doc sees the convention name and knows immediately what is browser-safe and what is server-only. The naming scheme is the API. Other variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`) silently return `undefined` in the browser, so a write of `process.env.DATABASE_URL` from a component fails closed instead of leaking the secret.

# The `Deliberately deferred` list

Inside AGENTS.md there is a section called `Deliberately deferred`. It lists things WebJs does not do and will not do in v1:

- Bundling (WebJs is no-build; do not propose `webjs build`)
- Per-route code splitting (downstream of no-build)
- Vite-grade HMR (hot module replacement) with state preservation
- React Server Components Flight
- i18n / image optimization (layer libraries on top)

The reason this is here is that agents will otherwise try to add these things. They see Next.js doing them and assume WebJs should too. The doc says no, here are the trade-offs, do not propose this.

This list is read at the start of every long-running session. Saves cycles.

# What this does not look like

It does not look like a chat box. It does not look like a code-suggestion popup. It does not look like a marketing message. It is a stack of operational decisions that, together, mean an agent dropped into a WebJs project writes correct code without asking what the framework wants.

Each individual piece is unsexy. The pre-commit hook is 100 lines of bash. The lint rules are short string-matching predicates. AGENTS.md is a wall of text. None of this is exciting on its own.

What is exciting is watching an agent take the framework as a given. No "where does this go" questions. No second tries because the lint caught a violation. No silent breakage because the test suite refused the commit. The agent just ships.

# What I am still figuring out

The hooks fragment across tools. Every new agent CLI (Cline, Codex, Factory Droid, Aider, etc.) wants its own hook format, and for a while the scaffold tried to keep up by shipping the same content in each one. That was a mistake, and I have since deleted those copies. Six near-identical files drift, and a drifted rule file is worse than a missing one, because an agent reads it and believes it. The bet now is that AGENTS.md becomes the universal contract, which is largely how it has played out, and that anything genuinely protective lives at a layer every tool has to pass through anyway. A pre-commit hook and a CI job do not care which agent wrote the code.

What I have not solved is enforcement for a tool that is not Claude Code. The blocking tool-call gates only fire there, so an agent in another editor gets the contract and the commit-time gates but not the live ones that catch a mistake as it is typed.

The other thing was the AGENTS.md size budget. It grew past 40k characters, and a teaching skill of about 65k words grew next to it, loaded on demand. I deleted both. An agent already knows Next.js routing and Lit components, so the better move was to make WebJs behave like them wherever it can, and to make every place it cannot refuse the code at `webjs check` or at load time with the fix in the message. What is left for the agent to read is the short brief, and the framework source in `node_modules`, which is the code that runs because there is no build.

If you are building tooling for AI agents, the takeaway is to put the rules where the agent will find them, in a format the agent can parse, with enforcement at the seams where mistakes happen. Everything else is a marketing tag.
