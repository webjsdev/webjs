# Require an approving review + all CI checks before a PR can merge into main.
#
# This is the enforcement half of .github/workflows/ci.yml: the workflow
# RUNS the tests, this rule BLOCKS merge until every required check is green
# AND the PR has at least one approving review. Run once (needs repo admin).
# Re-running is idempotent.
#
# NOTE on the review requirement: GitHub does not let a PR author approve
# their own PR, and this repo is effectively a solo org. enforce_admins is
# left false so the org owner can still merge via the admin bypass (a
# confirm step), which keeps the approval as a visible speed-bump without
# locking solo PRs. Flip enforce_admins to true only once a second reviewer
# (a human or a bot account) exists to provide the non-author approval.
#
#   bash scripts/protect-main.sh
#
# The contexts below must match the `name:` of each job in ci.yml exactly,
# because GitHub keys required status checks on the job display name.
