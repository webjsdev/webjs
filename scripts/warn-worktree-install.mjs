/**
 * Root `preinstall` reporter: name what an install in a LINKED worktree just did
 * to the PRIMARY checkout's `node_modules` (#1442).
 *
 * ## This reports, it never blocks, and that is deliberate
 *
 * Measured on npm 11.19.0 and bun 1.3.14, a `preinstall` script cannot PREVENT
 * the damage, so trying to make it a guard would be a guard in name only:
 *
 * - Under `npm install`, `preinstall` runs with `node_modules` ALREADY a real
 *   directory. npm replaced the symlink before the script started, so a
 *   `lstatSync('node_modules').isSymbolicLink()` check can never be true here.
 * - Under `npm ci`, `preinstall` runs with the primary's `node_modules` ALREADY
 *   emptied. npm deletes the link's TARGET first, so the destruction precedes
 *   any chance to stop it.
 * - Under `bun install` / `bun add`, `preinstall` runs BEFORE the write and does
 *   see the symlink, but a non-zero exit does not stop Bun (measured: `bun
 *   install` exited 0 with a `preinstall` that exited 2).
 * - A non-zero `preinstall` DOES block `npm install` and `npm ci`, exit code
 *   propagated verbatim, so a buggy guard here would red every CI job. The same
 *   reasoning is already written into `scripts/git-worktree-safe.mjs`.
 *
 * Blocking `npm install` would also leave the worktree with no symlink and a
 * half-built tree, which is worse than what it prevented. So the prevention
 * lives in `.claude/hooks/block-install-in-linked-worktree.sh`, which is the only
 * layer that runs before the package manager, and this script turns a silent
 * detach or a silently emptied primary into a named diagnosis with the repair.
 *
 * Silent and exit 0 in a normal clone, which is what CI has, because the first
 * thing it checks is whether `.git` is a FILE (the linked-worktree marker).
