/**
 * Link a fresh git worktree's dependencies to the primary checkout's, so the
 * worktree can run the test suite without a full `npm install`.
 *
 * A git worktree does not copy `node_modules`, and this repo needs MORE than
 * the root one:
 *
 * - **Every nested `node_modules`**, not just the root. npm hoists what it can,
 *   but a workspace whose range conflicts with the hoisted copy keeps its own
 *   nested tree. `packages/server` is the live example: the root has `ws@7`
 *   (hoisted for another dependent) while `packages/server` declares `^8.20.0`
 *   and carries `ws@8` nested. Link only the root and `WebSocketServer`, a
 *   ws@8-only named export, resolves up to ws@7 and throws at module load,
 *   which surfaces as dozens of unrelated-looking failures across the server,
 *   integration, and smoke suites.
 * - **`packages/core/dist`**, which is gitignored and built rather than
 *   committed. Tests that import the built bundle cannot resolve it in a fresh
 *   worktree. It is BUILT here from this worktree's own sources, never linked
 *   (#1671). A link at the primary's dist served the primary's bundle, built at
 *   another commit, so e2e and Bun ran the wrong code, and any build in the
 *   worktree (core's `prepare` during `npm ci` included) wrote through it into
 *   the primary.
 *
 * The `node_modules` set is discovered from the primary checkout rather than
 * hardcoded, because it changes whenever a package gains a nested tree.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT give you
 *
 * The worktree runs the PRIMARY checkout's framework source through every bare
 * `@webjsdev/*` specifier. `<primary>/node_modules/@webjsdev/core` is a relative
 * symlink into `<primary>/packages/core`, so resolving through the linked root
 * lands in the primary, not here. Relative imports (`../../../src/x.js`) and the
 * browser suite, which web-test-runner serves from this worktree, do use the
 * worktree's own files.
 *
 * So this makes the suite RUNNABLE, not self-testing. If you are editing
 * `packages/core/src` or `packages/server/src` and need a bare-specifier
 * consumer to exercise YOUR copy, run `npm run worktree:unlink` first and then
 * install, or point the individual `@webjsdev/<pkg>` entries at this worktree
 * instead. `--unlink` removes every `node_modules` link this script planted,
 * root and nested, and nothing else. CI always builds from the branch, so it is
 * unaffected either way.
 *
 * NEVER install while the link is standing (#1442). Measured on npm 11.19.0 and
 * bun 1.3.14: `npm ci` DELETES the primary's whole `node_modules` through the
 * link before any lifecycle script runs, `bun install` writes packages into the
 * primary through it, and `npm install` silently replaces the link with a real
 * tree. All three land on a checkout you are not working in, so the failure
 * surfaces in someone else's session with nothing naming the cause.
 *
 * Safety rules, all of which exist because the naive version of this script
 * broke a worktree while it was being written:
 *
 * - Never delete or overwrite anything, with ONE exception: the repair pass over
 *   `<primary>/node_modules/@webjsdev/` replaces a link that is ALREADY wrong
 *   (dangling, or resolving outside the primary) and removes a DANGLING
 *   `.name-HASH` npm staging entry. It never touches a real directory, never
 *   touches a link that is already correct, and never removes a staging entry
 *   that still resolves. Outside that pass, a path that already exists is left
 *   alone, so a worktree with a real `npm install` is untouched and re-running
 *   links nothing new. Two deliberate writes sit beside this rule: the core
 *   dist build rewrites `packages/core/dist`, which is that build's own output
 *   in this worktree, and the explicit `--unlink` mode removes the links this
 *   script planted.
 * - Never create a dangling link. A source that does not exist is skipped,
 *   because a dangling `node_modules` resolves more confusingly than a missing
 *   one, and the repair pass declines to repoint when the corrected target is
 *   missing.
 * - Never treat `<primary>/node_modules` itself as a search root. Descending
 *   into it yields thousands of nested `node_modules` belonging to third-party
 *   packages, none of which should be linked.
 *
 * Usage, from anywhere inside the worktree (the worktree ROOT is resolved with
 * `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, so a subdirectory works the same):
 *
 *   node scripts/link-worktree-deps.mjs           # link from the default primary
 *   node scripts/link-worktree-deps.mjs <primary> # or name it explicitly
 *   node scripts/link-worktree-deps.mjs --check   # report repairs, change nothing
 *   node scripts/link-worktree-deps.mjs --unlink  # remove every link it planted
 *
 * `--check` and `--unlink` together are refused: `--check` promises to change
 * nothing, and `--unlink` exists to change something.
 *   npm run worktree:link
 *   npm run worktree:unlink
 *   npm run check:worktree-links

// test sets `WEBJS_NO_WORKTREE_SEED=1` for exactly this reason. Without it,
