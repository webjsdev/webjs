/**
 * Bun test matrix driver (#509).
 *
 * Runs the runtime-sensitive `node:test` files (under `test/`, `packages/core/test/`,
 * and `packages/server/test/`, excluding `browser/`, the `e2e/` gate, and the
 * live-CDN `*.live.test.*` files) under Bun, file by file via `bun test <file>`.
 *
 * SOUNDNESS: the runner does NOT classify failures into skips (a self-classifying
 * runner can silently hide a real bug behind a "skip", which defeats the purpose).
 * The ONLY skips are an EXPLICIT, documented `DENYLIST` of files that assert
 * Node-only behavior or trip a Bun test-runner quirk, each with a reason and a
 * note of where the Bun-relevant behavior IS covered. Every other file MUST pass:
 * a non-zero exit, ANY failed test, or zero tests run (a silent compat gap) is a
 * genuine failure that fails the job. So a real cross-runtime bug can only ever
 * surface as a failure, never be auto-skipped.
 *
 * The Node suite (`npm test`) stays the source of truth; this matrix is additive.
 * Set `WEBJS_BUN_TESTS=…` to a comma-separated path-substring filter to scope a
 * local run.
