/**
 * The layout's own markup (the header and the counter) sits OUTSIDE the
 * children range the SSR emits around `${children}`. That split is the whole
 * fixture: a page-edit morph rewrites only what is inside the range, so the
 * counter's hydrated state survives it, while a layout edit needs the
 * whole-body `shell` swap and therefore re-creates it (#1398).
 *
 * The inline script is the RELOAD detector, and it is written to be immune to
 * re-execution on purpose. A `shell` swap re-runs the scripts it swaps in, so a
 * counter would advance and say nothing about whether the document reloaded.
 * A token that only ever assigns when absent survives a re-run and can only
 * change when the whole global scope is replaced, which is exactly a reload.
 *
 * The stylesheet link is HOISTED into `<head>` by the SSR (a leading body tag
 * is collected into the head before the response is served), which is what
 * makes the re-request assertion meaningful: neither swap tier ever removes a
 * head stylesheet, so nothing but the dev client's explicit stylesheet refresh
 * can cause the browser to ask for it again.
