/**
 * Cross-runtime app boot-check for the routes CI would not otherwise
 * exercise. That is now one app, `website`, which serves the marketing pages,
 * the documentation at /docs (#1098), and the component gallery at /ui
 * (#1099). The docs.webjs.dev and ui.webjs.dev redirect hosts are deliberately
 * absent: every route on them is an empty 301, which would pass this check
 * vacuously.
 * All the in-repo apps DEPLOY on Bun in production (#541), but only
 * `examples/blog` had Bun coverage in CI (the blog-on-bun e2e), so a per-route
 * break that occurs only on Bun could reach production undetected. The #526
 * incident was exactly this: the component detail pages served 500s because
 * the prod start bypassed the registry copy, and Railway's liveness-only
 * healthcheck never probed an individual route.
 *
 * This runs under WHICHEVER runtime executes it (Bun in the CI `bun` job, and
 * Node via `scripts/run-bun-tests.js`): it runs each app's `webjs.start.before`
 * presteps (the registry copy + the Tailwind build, exactly what `webjs start`
 * runs), boots the app via `createRequestHandler({ dev: false })`, GETs real
 * routes (including a gallery component detail page, the #526 route class),
 * and asserts status < 400 plus no broken same-origin `modulepreload` hint
 * (the #158 / #159 probe). Fails LOUD with a non-zero exit.
 *
 * Left as-is: `examples/blog` already has its own Bun e2e (#523 / #525), so it
 * is not duplicated here.
