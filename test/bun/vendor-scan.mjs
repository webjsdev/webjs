/**
 * Cross-runtime proof that the vendor specifier scan (#1399) is IDENTICAL
 * under whichever runtime runs it:
 *
 *   node test/bun/vendor-scan.mjs
 *   bun  test/bun/vendor-scan.mjs
 *
 * WebJs runs on Node 24+ AND Bun (#508), and an app scaffolded with `--runtime
 * bun` runs its whole analysis under Bun, so a vendor set that differed
 * between runtimes would serve a Bun author a different importmap from the
 * same source. The scan is `readdir` plus regular expressions over a redaction
 * mask with no runtime-specific API, so there is nothing legitimate to skip
 * and this file carries no DENYLIST entry.
 *
 * Both entry points are asserted, because they answer deliberately different
 * questions and the relation between them is load-bearing: `scanBareImports`
 * is the out-of-process pin-side superset (no elision pruning) and
 * `reachedBareImports` is the dev server's in-process runtime set (pruned).
 * `prunePinToReachable` intersects the first down to the second, so a runtime
 * set that stopped being a subset would break pinned/unpinned parity (#197).
 *
 * Imports are RELATIVE on purpose: a bare `@webjsdev/server` specifier
 * resolves through the primary checkout's node_modules in a linked worktree,
 * which would test a different copy of the source than the branch. Run from
 * the repo root so `@webjsdev/core` resolves for the fixture's components.
