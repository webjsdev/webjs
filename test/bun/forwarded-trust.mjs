/**
 * Cross-runtime proof for the reverse-proxy TRUST posture (#1097, #1104): boot
 * a real WebJs app through `startServer` and assert, under WHICHEVER runtime
 * runs it, that
 *
 *   1. a hostile `X-Forwarded-Host` cannot poison the SHARED HTML response
 *      cache for a later visitor who sends no such header (#1097), and
 *   2. `WEBJS_NO_TRUST_PROXY=1` is honored by every forwarded-header reader,
 *      including the CSRF host resolution that used to ignore it (#1104).
 *
 *   node test/bun/forwarded-trust.mjs   # the node:http shell (urlFromRequest -> toWebRequest)
 *   bun  test/bun/forwarded-trust.mjs   # the Bun.serve shell (applyForwarded -> forwardedRequest)
 *
 * Both shells matter and can fail independently. The URL correction runs in a
 * different place on each (`startNodeListener` builds its `Request` from an
 * already-corrected url; `listener-bun.js` rebuilds one via `forwardedRequest`),
 * and the cache key is computed downstream from whatever url that produced. A
 * shell that corrected the origin differently would key differently, so the
 * poisoning could be closed on one runtime and open on the other. This is the
 * companion to `forwarded-proto.mjs`, which proves the CORRECTION itself; this
 * file proves what is TRUSTED and what the correction is then allowed to reach.
 *
 * A plain assert script (not node:test), so the SAME file runs on both runtimes.
 * Run from the repo root so the bare `@webjsdev/server` specifier resolves.
 *
 * The failure is reported by an explicit `process.exit(1)` rather than by
 * letting the assertion propagate, because `startServer` installs an
 * `uncaughtException` handler that begins a graceful shutdown and exits 0. On
 * Bun a top-level assertion failure routes through that handler, so a broken
 * proof would exit 0 and CI's `bun test/bun/<file>.mjs` step would go GREEN on a
 * real regression (#1092, the shape every proof script here shares).
