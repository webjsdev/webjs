/**
 * Cross-runtime dev static-serve test (#1397): in dev, `GET /public/*` must be
 * answered BEFORE the whole-app analysis completes, on BOTH the node:http and
 * `Bun.serve` listener shells.
 *
 * The hoist moves a serve branch earlier in the request path, and the two
 * listener shells reach `handle()` differently (the Bun shell may rebuild the
 * `Request` in `forwardedRequest` and classifies the response body through
 * `readBufferedOrStream` / `compressBufferSync`), so the invariant is worth
 * proving on each runtime rather than on Node alone.
 *
 * The fixture's root middleware module has a top-level await sleep, and
 * `loadMiddleware` runs inside `ensureReady()`, so the analysis is
 * deterministically slow with no network involved. `/__webjs/ready` stays 503
 * until the analysis lands, which is the observable the assertion pivots on.
 *
 * COUNTERFACTUAL: revert the dev-only `tryServePublicAsset` call ahead of
 * `await ensureReady()` in dev.js and the CSS request cannot resolve until warm
 * completes, so `/__webjs/ready` is already 200 by the time it does.
 *
 *   node test/bun/dev-public-before-warm.mjs
 *   bun  test/bun/dev-public-before-warm.mjs

// A distinct base is NOT enough on its own, which is the trap here: a base
// only separates two files if the earlier one's modulus window stops before
// the later one's base, and among the existing dev-server scripts it does not.
// Their reachable RANGES are dev-reload-retry 9500-9739, dev-hot-reload
// 9700-9949, dev-extra-watch 9750-9989 and dev-overlay-scope 9800-9979, which
// overlap each other freely. That is pre-existing and not this file's to fix;
// what this file can do is sit entirely ABOVE all of them. 9989 is the highest
// port any of them reaches, so 10100-10355 cannot collide with any of the four
// for any pair of pids.
//
// The base ALSO has to clear 10080, and that is the constraint this file
// learned the hard way. 10080 is the last entry on the WHATWG Fetch bad-ports
// list, so `fetch()` rejects it with "bad port" before it opens a socket, and
// no server is involved in the failure at all. The range used to be
// 10000-10255, which contains it, so a run whose pid happened to be 80 mod 256
// failed every request in this file with a TypeError that named nothing in the
// code under test. It is about one run in 256 and deterministic given the pid,
// which is exactly what makes it read as flake. Nothing above 10080 is blocked
// (verified by scanning 9400-10700: 10080 is the only one), so any base past it
// is permanently safe.
//
// The per-pid offset is NOT doing that work and should
// not be credited with it: the node and bun runs are sequential steps and each
// runner runs a given file once, so nothing here races for a port. It is only
// defensive against a leftover socket from a prior run lingering in TIME_WAIT,
// which is the same account `dev-hot-reload.mjs` gives of the identical
// `base + pid % n` construct.
