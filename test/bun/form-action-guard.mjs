/**
 * Cross-runtime proof that the form-action leak guard (#1154) refuses
 * identically on Node and Bun. Run from the repo root:
 *
 *   node test/bun/form-action-guard.mjs
 *   bun  test/bun/form-action-guard.mjs
 *
 * WebJs runs on Node 24+ OR Bun, and the guard sits in the SSR template state
 * machines, so a divergence here is a divergence in whether a server action's
 * source reaches the served HTML. That is the one failure mode where "it works
 * on Node" is not good enough: an app deployed on Bun would leak silently while
 * the Node test suite stayed green.
 *
 * The runtime-sensitive part is not the string building, it is what each engine
 * does with `String(fn)` and with the async render path around it. Assertions
 * therefore check for the SECRET marker rather than for a stringification
 * shape, and the reason is worth stating precisely, because the obvious one is
 * wrong. `Function.prototype.toString` is spec'd to return the exact source
 * text, so JSC and V8 do NOT format it differently. What differs is that Bun
 * TRANSPILES the module before the engine ever sees it, so the source a
 * function reports is the rewritten source:
 *
 *   node 26.1.0 : async function leaky(input) { const conn = '…'; return { ok: true, conn, input }; }
 *   bun  1.3.14 : async function leaky(input) { return { ok: !0, conn: "…", input }; }
 *
 * Constant folded, `true` minified to `!0`, reindented. A string LITERAL
 * survives that intact, which is exactly why the marker is the right thing to
 * assert on and a formatting pattern is not.

// The marker is written INLINE, not read from a module-scope `const`.

// saying `const conn = SECRET` stringifies to the identifier and never contains
// the marker, which would make every `!includes(BUN_PARITY_SECRET)` assertion
// below trivially true and this whole file proof of nothing.
//
// On Bun the same construction MIGHT instead expose the marker, because Bun can
// fold a module-scope `const` string into the body. Whether it does here is not
// worth deriving: four attempts to state the folding rule were measured while
// this guard was reviewed, and each was falsified by the next.
//
// That unpredictability IS the argument for inlining. A test whose marker is
// visible only under some transpiler heuristic is a test that can go quietly
// tautological when the heuristic shifts, which is exactly what it must never
// do. Inlining removes the dependency instead of reasoning about it.
