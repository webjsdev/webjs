/**
 * An offline stand-in for api.jspm.io and ga.jspm.io (#1150).
 *
 * The required `Unit + integration` CI job used to resolve vendors against the
 * live jspm CDN, so a jspm outage redded pull requests that had nothing to do
 * with vendoring (#1149 was a five-file documentation change). This double is
 * what the vendor tests resolve against instead. Exactly one file in the tree,
 * `packages/server/test/vendor/jspm-cdn.live.test.js`, still talks to the real
 * CDN, and both test runners keep `*.live.test.*` out of a normal run.
 *
 * It models jspm rather than merely answering, because `packages/server/src/
 * vendor.js` is built on jspm's exact failure semantics. `jspmGenerate` sends
 * one unified call for a multi-install set, and its whole fallback ladder keys
 * off what comes back: a 5xx or a 429 is transient and retries per package, a
 * 4xx is permanent and triggers per-install probes so the resolvable ones
 * survive. A double that answered every request with a 200 would leave that
 * ladder untested while looking green.
 *
 * The `/double.js` tail on every minted URL is load-bearing. Real jspm never
 * emits it, so a test can assert on it to prove it is talking to this double
 * and not to the network. `test/vendor-cli/vendor-cli.test.mjs` does exactly
 * that, because its own `ga.jspm.io/npm:picocolors@` prefix check is equally
 * true of the real CDN and so cannot notice the double being unplugged.
 *
 * REFUSAL IS RECORDED, NOT THROWN. Every fetch caller in vendor.js swallows a
 * throw (`jspmCall`, `downloadBundle`, `fetchIntegrity`, `fetchLiveIntegrity`
 * all catch and degrade), so a double that threw on an unexpected request
 * would silently turn into "resolved nothing" and a weak assertion would still
 * pass. Unexpected requests land on `double.unexpected` instead, which
 * `withJspmDouble` asserts is empty and the preload turns into a non-zero exit.
 *
 * It only needs jspm-SHAPED urls and some bytes, and it must never pass
 * anything through to the real network.
 *
 * This module has NO side effects. Importing it patches nothing; call
 * `jspmDouble()` or `withJspmDouble()` to use it.
