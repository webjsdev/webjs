/**
 * Parse a jspm install string into its package name, version, and subpath.
 *
 * `test/fixtures/jspm-double.mjs` (#1150) uses it to mint a jspm-shaped URL.
 * It would otherwise reach for the `install.replace(/@[^@]*$/, '')` shortcut
 * that several inline mocks in
 * `packages/server/test/vendor/vendor.test.js` use, which is wrong on any
 * install carrying a subpath: on `dayjs@1.11.13/plugin/utc` the trailing
 * `@1.11.13/plugin/utc` is one match, so the whole subpath disappears with the
 * version and the caller believes the install was a bare `dayjs`.
 *
 * This module has NO side effects, so importing it never patches anything.

/**
 * Split an install string into its package name, version, and subpath.
 *
 * The four shapes, all of which jspm accepts: `dayjs`, `dayjs@1.11.21`,
 * `dayjs/plugin/utc`, `dayjs@1.11.21/plugin/utc`, each also in scoped form
 * (`@scope/pkg...`). So the version is OPTIONAL and the subpath does not always
 * ride behind one, which rules out cutting at the version separator alone: on
 * `dayjs/plugin/utc` there is no `@` to cut at, and taking the whole string as
 * the name would report no subpath for an install that plainly has one.
 *
 * Cut on the first `/` that is not part of a scope instead, then strip any
 * version off the name. A scoped name's leading `@` is not a version separator
 * and its first `/` is not a subpath, hence the offsets.
 *
 * @param {string} install
 * @returns {{ name: string, version: string, subpath: string }}
