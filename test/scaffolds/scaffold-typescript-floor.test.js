/**
 * The generated `package.json` must not permit a TypeScript that cannot read
 * the `tsconfig.json` the SAME generator writes.
 *
 * The scaffold shipped `"typescript": "^5.6.0"` alongside a tsconfig setting
 * `erasableSyntaxOnly`, which landed in TypeScript 5.8. Every version in the
 * lower half of that range refuses the config outright with
 * `TS5023: Unknown compiler option 'erasableSyntaxOnly'`, exit 2, nothing else
 * checked. It stayed invisible because `npm install` resolves a caret range to
 * the newest matching version, so a fresh scaffold picked up 5.9 and worked; it
 * bites a pinned install, an older lockfile, or a toolchain whose own compiler
 * is older. Nothing tied the two files together, so they were free to drift.
 *
 * This ties them. `REQUIRES` maps each compiler option the generator emits to
 * the TypeScript version that introduced it, and the test asserts two things:
 * the declared range's LOWEST satisfying version clears the highest floor among
 * the emitted options, and every emitted option is classified. The second half
 * is what keeps this from rotting: adding an option the table does not know
 * fails the test until someone records its floor, the same "classify it or CI
 * stays red" contract as the gallery-coverage manifest.
 *
 * Counterfactual: restore `^5.6.0` (or add an unclassified option) and this
 * fails.
