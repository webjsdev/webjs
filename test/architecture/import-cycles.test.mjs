/**
 * D4: the #1365 split must not leave the framework's module graph tangled.
 *
 * `main` has zero import cycles across the three package source trees. This
 * branch introduced 70, in four components spanning 31 modules. Almost all of
 * that was misfiled code rather than real recursion, and removing it took the
 * graph to the two components asserted below.
 *
 * The criterion is therefore amended from "zero cycles" to "exactly these two,
 * and nothing new". The two that remain are mutual recursion by design:
 *
 * - The client router: a navigation fetches, the fetch applies a swap, the swap
 *   upgrades the new elements, and an upgraded element can start a navigation.
 * - Light-DOM slots: projecting assignments installs the mutation interceptors,
 *   and an intercepted mutation re-projects.
 *
 * Breaking either needs a late-bound seam (a module holding a mutable function
 * slot the engine registers into), which trades a static import edge for a
 * runtime one. That is a real cost here rather than a stylistic one, because
 * the elision analyser reads this same module graph statically to decide what
 * the browser downloads; an edge it cannot see is an edge it cannot follow.
 *
 * Cycles are not inherently broken in ESM: a function declaration is hoisted,
 * so mutual recursion between function bodies resolves fine. The failure mode
 * the plan worried about is a TDZ error on a `const` or `class` read during
 * module evaluation, which shows up as a blank page in the minified bundle
 * rather than as a test failure. The browser suite running against the built
 * bundle on Chromium, Firefox and WebKit is what covers that.
 *
 * This test's job is to stop a THIRD component appearing unnoticed, and to
 * notice if one of these two ever grows.
