/**
 * The offline jspm double (#1150), tested on its own.
 *
 * `test/fixtures/jspm-double.mjs` is what keeps a jspm outage from redding the
 * required CI job, and it is the kind of thing that can rot silently: a double
 * that answers the wrong shape makes the vendor tests pass for the wrong
 * reason, which is strictly worse than the live dependency it replaced. So the
 * contract it owes `packages/server/src/vendor.js` is pinned here.
 *
 * Three properties carry most of the weight.
 *
 * The URL SHAPE. `pinAll` recovers a flattened transitive's version by locating
 * `<name>@<version>` inside the resolved url (`derivePinParts`), and derives a
 * `--download` filename from it. A double that dropped the version, or that
 * collapsed a subpath into the package name, would make `pinAll` report a
 * failure that looks like a product bug.
 *
 * The WHOLE-BATCH 401. Real jspm fails the entire call when any one install is
 * unresolvable, and `jspmGenerate`'s per-install probing exists only because of
 * that. A double that answered a partial map would leave the probing untested.
 * The premise itself is re-checked against the real API by
 * `packages/server/test/vendor/jspm-cdn.live.test.js`.
 *
 * The REFUSAL. Every fetch caller in vendor.js catches, so an unserved request
 * cannot be signalled by throwing: it would be indistinguishable from the CDN
 * being down, and would quietly weaken whatever test hit it. It is recorded
 * instead, and `withJspmDouble` fails the test on any recorded entry.
 *
 * This file installs no global fetch of its own and calls the double directly,
 * so it is network-free by construction rather than by discipline.
