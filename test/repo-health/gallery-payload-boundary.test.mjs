/**
 * The gallery / scaffold payload boundary.
 *
 * `gallery/` does double duty. It is the single canonical source of the feature
 * gallery that `webjs create` copies into every generated app, AND it is a live
 * app deployed on its own at gallery.webjs.dev. Those two roles want opposite
 * things from its design: the deployed app should carry WebJs branding, and the
 * copied demos must stay neutral, because an app-building agent reads them for
 * idioms and a vividly branded example outweighs a prose instruction telling it
 * to choose its own palette.
 *
 * Both hold at once only because a narrow set of files is gallery-only, namely
 * the four in `packages/cli/lib/gallery-shell-files.js` plus all of
 * `gallery/public/`, which neither copier reads. Nothing enforced that split
 * before this file: `copyGallery()`'s filter could stop filtering, a brand
 * helper could be added under `gallery/lib/`, or the two copiers' directory
 * lists could drift, and every existing suite would stay green while WebJs
 * branding shipped into every generated app.
 *
 * Three assertions, because each catches a regression the other two miss, and
 * each was confirmed to fail against a deliberately broken tree.
 *
 * This lives in the REPO suite rather than in `gallery/test/`, for the reason
 * `gallery-favicon.test.mjs` states in its own header: `gallery/test/**` is
 * itself scaffold payload, so a guard placed there would be copied into every
 * generated app, where the thing it guards does not exist, and a stray
 * directory also defeats `gallery:clear`'s prune of an empty `test/` (asserted
 * by test/scaffolds/scaffold-gallery.test.js).

/**
 * What actually keeps the gallery's branded shell out of a generated app is the

 * this test was written against:
 *
 *   L1134  writeUiBootstrap()                    writes lib/utils/cn.ts
 *   L1185  copyGallery()                         copies the gallery
 *   L1187  writeFile(app/layout.ts)              overwrites
 *   L1376  writeFile(app/page.ts)                overwrites
 *   L1455  writeFile(components/theme-toggle.ts) overwrites
 *
 * Three of the four shell files are rewritten by the generator AFTER the copy,
 * and the fourth is byte-identical to the gallery's (both are read verbatim
 * from packages/ui/packages/registry/lib/utils.ts, deliberately, so that
 * `webjs ui add` stays in lockstep with the kit). Neutering the filter
 * therefore changes NOTHING about the generated output, which was confirmed by
 * running that exact counterfactual: an equality check on the generated files
 * stays green with the filter fully removed, so it is tautological rather than
 * discriminating and is not worth having.
 *
 * The filter is real defence-in-depth (it keeps the shell out of the published
 * `templates/gallery/` bundle) but it is not the load-bearing mechanism. So
 * assert the mechanism that is: the three generator writes must follow the
 * copy. Move `copyGallery()` below any of them and the gallery's branded shell
 * wins, which is precisely the regression this file exists to catch.
