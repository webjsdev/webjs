/**
 * The gallery's favicon: linked, served, and the real brand mark.
 *
 * gallery.webjs.dev rendered with a blank tab. `gallery/app/icon.ts` answered
 * /icon the whole time, but a metadata ROUTE is not auto-linked: the framework
 * emits `<link rel="icon">` only from `metadata.icons`
 * (packages/server/src/ssr.js), and the gallery's root layout declared only a
 * title and a description. So the head named no icon, the browser fell back to
 * /favicon.ico, and the gallery shipped no such file. Linking /icon then fixed
 * the blank tab with the DEMO route's placeholder grey "w" rather than the
 * WebJs mark webjs.dev serves, so the gallery read as a different product in a
 * tab strip.
 *
 * Three independent things have to hold and each stayed green while another was
 * broken, so all three are asserted: the head must LINK an icon, every URL it
 * links must be SERVED, and the bytes must be the BRAND mark. The last is why
 * the middle is not enough, since a linked-and-served placeholder is
 * indistinguishable from the real thing to the request pipeline.
 *
 * This lives in the REPO suite rather than in `gallery/test/`, for two reasons.
 * It is a cross-app assertion (it reads `website/public/`, which exists only
 * here), and `gallery/test/**` is scaffold PAYLOAD: `copyGallery()` copies it
 * into every generated app, where a `website/` to compare against never exists
 * and where a stray directory also defeats `gallery:clear`'s prune of an empty
 * `test/` (asserted by test/scaffolds/scaffold-gallery.test.js).
 *
 * Companion to site-seo-tags.test.mjs, which covers the website's own icons.
 * That one asserts hand-written `<link>` markup because the website writes its
 * icons that way; this renders the page instead, because the gallery declares
 * them through metadata.icons and there is no markup in the layout to read.
