/**
 * Cross-app SEO-tag invariants for the in-repo web apps (#1088).
 *
 * webjs.dev, the docs, and ui.webjs.dev each shipped the SAME two defects,
 * because each root layout was copied from the last:
 *
 *  1. `<link rel="icon" ... sizes="32x32">` pointing at an asset that is
 *     really 512x512. The declared size was wrong AND under Google's floor
 *     (it wants a square whose side is a multiple of 48px), so webjs.dev
 *     showed no favicon in search results at all.
 *  2. No `<link rel="canonical">` anywhere, so every query-string and
 *     trailing-slash variant of every URL split its ranking signals.
 *
 * A per-app test would not have caught the copy-paste spread, so this asserts
 * the invariant across every app at once. Adding an app to APPS is the
 * intended way to bring it under the same guard.
 *
 * The docs are no longer a separate app here (#1098): they are served by the
 * website at /docs and share its root layout, so the website row now covers
 * them. `docs.webjs.dev` still resolves, but as a Cloudflare redirect rule
 * with nothing indexable of its own, which is the point of the move.
 *
 * The icon assertions RENDER the app rather than reading its layout source.
 * They used to regex the layout for hand-written `<link>` markup, which
 * pinned an authoring style the framework tells apps not to use: only a ROOT
 * layout may write a shell at all (invariant 8), so a hand-written tag is a
 * pattern no other layout can copy, and favicons are declared through
 * `metadata.icons`. Rendering asserts what a browser actually receives, which
 * is the thing that matters and is also the only way to see icons the
 * framework splices in. The canonical check stays source-level: it asserts
 * how the value is DERIVED (origin plus pathname, trailing slash stripped),
 * which one rendered URL cannot show.
