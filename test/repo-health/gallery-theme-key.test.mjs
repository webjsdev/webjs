/**
 * The gallery's theme bootstrap and its toggle must read and write ONE key.
 *
 * They disagreed: `gallery/components/theme-toggle.ts` persisted the reader's
 * choice under `webjs_theme` while the inline bootstrap in
 * `gallery/app/layout.ts` read `theme`. So the bootstrap looked up a key nothing
 * ever wrote, found nothing, applied no `data-theme`, and every reader who had
 * chosen a theme got a first paint in the OTHER one, then a flash when the
 * toggle upgraded and corrected it.
 *
 * That is a first-paint timing property, which is exactly the shape a test
 * runner cannot observe reliably: by the time any assertion runs, the toggle has
 * upgraded and the two agree again. So this asserts the invariant STATICALLY,
 * on the source, which is both cheap and the only place the defect is visible.
 *
 * `webjs_theme` is the repo-wide key, not an arbitrary pick. The generated app
 * (`packages/cli/lib/create.js`), `examples/blog` and `website/lib/theme.ts`
 * (as `THEME_STORAGE_KEY`) all use it, so this also pins the gallery to the
 * convention rather than letting it drift back to a private key.
 *
 * Lives in the REPO suite, not `gallery/test/`, for the reason
 * `gallery-favicon.test.mjs` states in its own header: `gallery/test/**` is
 * scaffold payload and would be copied into every generated app, where the
 * gallery's layout does not exist.
