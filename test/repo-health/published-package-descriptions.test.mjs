/**
 * The `description` of every published package is a search surface (#1100).
 *
 * npmjs.com ranks well for framework names, and the `description` field is
 * exactly what renders as the result snippet. Every description used to say
 * what THAT package does without ever saying what the project is, so a
 * stranger landing on @webjsdev/core from a search learned that it ships
 * "html/css tags" and never learned this is a web framework at all.
 *
 * Two of the descriptions also violated AGENTS.md invariant 11 (the brand
 * written lowercase in prose, and a space-hyphen used as pause punctuation).
 * The prose hook never caught them because it scans only NEW content, and
 * these predate it.
 *
 * So this asserts the invariant across EVERY published package at once rather
 * than per package. The package list is DERIVED (every non-private manifest
 * under the three workspace base dirs), so a new published package is covered
 * the moment it lands instead of when someone remembers to add it here.
 *
 * Note the descriptions on npmjs.com only change when a package is
 * REPUBLISHED. npm renders them from the published tarball's manifest, not
 * from this repository, so this test guards the source of truth for the next
 * release rather than what is live right now.
