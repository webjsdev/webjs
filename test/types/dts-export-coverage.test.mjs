/**
 * Drift guard for issue #388: each published package's hand-maintained `.d.ts`
 * overlay must declare a SUPERSET of its runtime named exports, so every
 * `import { x } from '<pkg>'` that works at runtime also type-checks. The
 * `@webjsdev/core` overlay had drifted (36 of 82 runtime exports missing, incl.
 * `WebComponent`, `signal`, the whole directive set, the serializer).
 *
 * For each entry point it reads the runtime export names DYNAMICALLY (so the
 * guard can never go stale as exports are added), then tsc-checks a fixture that
 * imports every one from the overlay. A missing declaration surfaces as a
 * `no exported member` error naming the symbol. The counterfactual is built in:
 * drop any export from the `.d.ts` and this fails with that name.
 *
 * The entry list is READ from each package's own `exports` (#1291), the same way
 * the reverse guard (`dts-no-phantom-exports.test.mjs`, #1031) already does, so a
 * new subpath is forward-checked with no edit here. It used to be a hardcoded
 * three-element array while fifteen overlays existed, which left twelve subpaths
 * unguarded in this direction.
