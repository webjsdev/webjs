/**
 * Differential elision test, SSR layer (issue #181).
 *
 * Elision's defining invariant is that removing the elided JS NEVER changes
 * observable output. Rather than enumerate the heuristic's long tail of
 * inputs with example-based assertions (which missed #169 and #179), this
 * test verifies the invariant DIRECTLY: it renders a corpus of blog routes
 * with elision ON (default) and OFF (`WEBJS_ELIDE=0`) in one process and
 * asserts the served HTML is byte-identical once the JS-loaded set (the
 * importmap, the boot module script, the modulepreload hints, and the
 * build-id hash derived from them) is masked out. Only the DANGEROUS
 * direction (elision changed what the SSR emits) can fail here; the SAFE
 * direction (over-ship) lives entirely inside the masked region.
 *
 * The browser-after-hydration half of the invariant (a wrongly-dropped
 * module breaking an interaction) is covered by the `differential elision`
 * cases in `test/e2e/e2e.test.mjs`.
