/**
 * GUARD TEST for the elision analyser's template-sigil + static-field
 * coverage, the sibling of lifecycle-coverage.test.js.
 *
 * lifecycle-coverage introspects WebComponent.prototype and fails if a new
 * method ships without the analyser being taught about it. But two
 * interactivity surfaces are NOT prototype methods or named exports, so that
 * guard cannot see them:
 *
 *   1. Template binding sigils (`@` / `.` / `?`). A new client-behaviour sigil
 *      added to the renderers without teaching the analyser would let it
 *      wrongly elide a component whose only interactivity is that sigil, and
 *      the failure would be silent in production.
 *   2. Interactivity-signal static fields (`static shadow` / `static interactive`).
 *
 * This test makes that drift LOUD. The renderers' sigil set lives in core's
 * BINDING_PREFIXES (single source of truth); the analyser classifies each as a
 * ship signal (SSR_DROPPED_PREFIXES) or an SSR-safe round-trip
 * (ROUND_TRIP_PREFIXES). The partition assertion below fails the moment a sigil
 * is added to BINDING_PREFIXES without being classified, so the fix is forced:
 * decide whether the new sigil ships and add it to the matching analyser list.
