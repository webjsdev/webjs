/**
 * Cross-origin (CSRF) protection for `/__webjs/action/*` RPC endpoints, via
 * Fetch-Metadata + Origin verification. This is the model Remix 3's
 * `cop-middleware` and Go 1.25's `http.CrossOriginProtection` use, and the
 * spiritual sibling of Next.js / Astro's Origin-vs-Host check.
 *
 * Why not a token cookie: WebJs previously issued a per-request `webjs_csrf`
 * double-submit cookie on every SSR response. That made SSR HTML
 * un-cacheable at a CDN (a CDN skips a response with `Set-Cookie`, and a
 * cached one would share / poison the token across visitors). A header check
 * needs nothing on the page, so SSR HTML carries no `Set-Cookie` and a page
 * that opts into a public `Cache-Control` is edge-cacheable.
 *
 * The check, on every state-changing verb (a safe GET is exempt):
 *   1. `Sec-Fetch-Site` is the primary signal. The browser sets it on every
 *      request and page JS cannot forge it. `same-origin` / `none` (a direct
 *      navigation with no initiator) pass; `same-site` / `cross-site` are
 *      rejected unless the source origin is in `webjs.allowedOrigins`.
 *   2. When `Sec-Fetch-Site` is absent (an older browser), fall back to
 *      comparing the `Origin` host to the request host; an absent `Origin`
 *      can't be checked so it passes (a handcrafted / non-browser request
 *      can't carry a victim's SameSite cookies cross-site anyway). That
 *      request host comes from `requestHost` below, which resolves
 *      `x-forwarded-host` through the shared `trustProxy()` seam in
 *      `forwarded.js` (#1104), so this file holds no trust posture of its own.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   - Internal RPC only. A `route.ts` REST endpoint (hand-written or via the
 *     `route()` adapter) is intentionally NOT covered here; it is for external
 *     consumers and must carry its own auth.
 *   - Session / auth cookies stay `SameSite=Lax` as defense-in-depth.

/**
 * The host the request was addressed to: `x-forwarded-host` when a proxy is
 * trusted to speak for the client (the Cloudflare-in-front-of-Railway setup),
 * then the `Host` header, then the request URL.
 *
 * Trust note, preserved from before this read went through `trustProxy()`
 * (#1104), because it is correct and non-obvious: reading `x-forwarded-host`
 * here was never a CSRF weakness. A CSRF attack is browser-driven and a
 * browser cannot set `x-forwarded-host` (or `Origin`); only a direct
 * non-browser client can, and such a client carries no victim SameSite
 * cookies to abuse. The primary `Sec-Fetch-Site` path does not reach this
 * function at all, only the legacy no-`Sec-Fetch-Site` fallback in
 * `verifyOrigin` does. The value CAN still be attacker-chosen, since a proxy
 * of the kind above forwards a client-supplied one rather than overwriting
 * it; see the threat model in `forwarded.js` for what that does reach.
 *
 * What changed is the POSTURE, not a hole: the read now honors
 * `WEBJS_NO_TRUST_PROXY=1` like every other forwarded-header read, so an
 * operator who sets the flag because their container is directly reachable
 * gets one answer from the whole package instead of two. Behind a proxy
 * WITHOUT the flag nothing changes. With the flag set on a genuinely proxied
 * deploy (a misconfiguration) the fallback compares `Origin` against the raw
 * `Host`, so a legitimate cross-host request can now be rejected. That is the
 * flag's intended meaning.
