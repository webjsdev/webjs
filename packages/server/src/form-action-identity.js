 * itself), but at SSR the value is the REAL server function, so something has
 * to have watched it load. The `'use server'` load hook did, which is why it
 * installs unconditionally rather than only when seeding is on.
 *
 * The naming is the RPC endpoint's, deliberately: the same `hashFile(file)`

/**
 * Warn that the dispatched module is not the defining one.
 *
 * Deliberately CONDITIONAL about the consequence. What is known here is cheap
 * and certain: the identity names a re-exporting module, so the dispatcher will
 * read config off that namespace. What that costs is not knowable without
 * loading the module, which this path refuses to do (it is a render-time
 * resolve, and eager-loading every action module is exactly the cost
 * `scanForIdentity` exists to avoid).
 *
 * Config is matched BY NAME off the dispatched namespace
 * (`actionConfigFn(mod, 'validate')`), with no association back to a particular
 * function, and that cuts BOTH ways. Three wordings have now been wrong by
 * describing only one direction:
 *
 *   - config declared beside the action does NOT travel with a plain
 *     `export { fn } from` re-export, so it stops applying
 *   - config the DISPATCHING module declares DOES apply to this action, even
 *     though it was written for one of that module's own exports
 *
 * The second is why "an action that declares no config loses nothing" was
 * false: a config-less action re-exported through a module that has a
 * `validate` for its own sibling inherits that validator, and its submissions
 * start failing with a message about a different action.
 *
 * It follows that re-exporting the config into a SHARED barrel is bad advice
 * (it attaches one action's validator to every sibling), while re-exporting it
 * into a module holding only this action is safe and is the only option when
 * the action lives in a workspace package several apps share, which is exactly
 * the case that produces this warning. The remedy has to offer both, and the
 * second needs its CONDITION stated: among indexed re-exporters the identity
 * goes to the first one LOADED (registration order, and module load is lazy per
 * route), so a stray second re-exporter can silently win over the remedy module
 * depending on which page a visitor hits first.
 *
 * The second remedy also cannot silence this line. The defining module stays
 * outside the index, so the fallback still runs and this check cannot see
 * inside the dispatched module to know the config now travels with it. Round 4
 * of this PR's review found a diagnostic that persisted in the state its own
 * remedy produced while still describing it as broken; the honest fix is the
 * message saying so itself.
 *
 * `webjs check` catches none of it: `one-action-per-configured-file` counts
 * callables from `export function` / `export const … =>`, so a re-exported
 * action is invisible to it (a pure barrel reads as zero callables).
