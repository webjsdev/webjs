 * Serialise the import map to an HTML script tag string.

 * `script-src 'nonce-...'` require this; without it the browser
 * blocks the importmap and every bare-specifier import fails.
 *
 * Defense-in-depth: JSON content is run through `jsonForScriptTag`
 * so a string value containing `</script>` (e.g. a maliciously
 * crafted vendor URL that somehow slipped past the jspm.io filter)
 * cannot close the importmap tag early and inject script content.
