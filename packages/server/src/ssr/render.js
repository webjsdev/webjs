/**
 * Downgrade a PARTIAL response so no shared cache can store it (#1140).
 *
 * A reduced `X-Webjs-Have` body is sliced by a REQUEST header, so it is valid
 * only for a client that sent it. It is marked `Vary` for that header, but
 * `Vary` is not a guarantee in practice: Cloudflare honours only
 * `Accept-Encoding` and several other shared caches are just as selective.
 * Since a reduced body otherwise INHERITS the page's `Cache-Control`, a page
 * that opted into public caching was handing CDNs a chrome-less fragment under
 * the full page's URL, to be served to whoever navigated there next. Measured
 * on webjs.dev: 71,759 bytes for the document versus 47,375 for the fragment,
 * identical `Cache-Control` on both.
 *
 * The reduced path is the ONLY caller. A `<webjs-frame>` subtree is sliced by a
 * request header too, but its response is built without page metadata, so it is
 * already `no-store` and needs no downgrade; that property is locked by a test
 * rather than by a call here. A NEW partial-response shape does not get this
 * treatment for free: call this from its response site.
 *
 * `private` fixes that at the source instead of relying on `Vary` being
 * respected: no shared cache may store it, while the browser that asked for it
 * still may. The freshness directives are preserved, so a returning client
 * keeps whatever reuse the page declared. `Vary` stays too, as belt-and-braces
 * for caches that do honour it.
 *
 * The response KEEPS its validator. `private` forbids shared storage, not
 * validation, so the funnel still attaches an ETag (see conditional-get.js,
 * which stopped excluding `private` for exactly this reason). That matters:
 * the router fetches partials with `cache: 'no-cache'` (#1131), so without a
 * validator every prefetch and soft navigation would re-download the whole
 * fragment instead of being answered 304.

/**
 * Report a throw from a layout wrapped around a boundary page (#1298) to the
 * same sinks a page-render error reaches, then let the caller degrade to the
 * standalone render. Best-effort on both sinks: a throwing sink must never
 * affect the response.
 *
 * A CONTROL-FLOW sentinel is not an error and is never reported. This is the
 * same classification the page path makes before it calls `onError` (a
 * `redirect()` / `notFound()` / `forbidden()` / `unauthorized()` is a routing
 * decision, not a crash), and it matters more here: reporting one would fire
 * the app's APM sink and paint a false dev error overlay OVER the 403 the user
 * is looking at.
 *
 * The sentinel is not HONOURED either, and that is deliberate. The status is
 * already decided by the time a boundary renders, and the boundary page IS the
 * answer to this request; letting a layout redirect out of it would replace a
 * 403 the app asked for with a bounce the app did not, on a path where the
 * redirect target could itself be forbidden. So the render degrades to the
 * standalone boundary body, exactly as it does for a real layout crash, and
 * the status the boundary carries is preserved.
 *
 * Deduplicated per request by CAUSE, via the caller's `seen` set. The 500 path
 * tries each boundary in the chain, and a throwing layout that is an ancestor
 * of several of them fails EVERY attempt: `layoutsForBoundary` selects by
 * segment ancestry rather than by boundary depth, so two boundaries at
 * different segments can resolve to the same layout set. Without dedup a root
 * layout that throws is reported once per boundary in the chain.
 *
 * The key is the error's name, message and throw site rather than its identity,
 * because a layout that constructs its error (`throw new Error(...)`) yields a
 * fresh object per attempt. Deduplicating on "any secondary failure already
 * reported" instead would be wrong in the other direction: an inner boundary
 * throwing a TypeError would silence a LATER, unrelated root-layout crash, and
 * would make the `global-error` report below unreachable on every route whose
 * chain contains a real `error.{js,ts}`, since reaching that block at all means
 * an earlier attempt already threw. Distinct causes are each reported once.
 *
 * `overlay` says whether this failure may claim the DEV OVERLAY. The overlay
 * holds one retained frame per URL and the dev handler's slot is last-write
 * wins, so a secondary failure pushed after the original page error would
 * replace the root cause with a symptom, and the replacement would survive a
 * reconnect. So the 500 path passes false (the page error already claimed the
 * slot and is what the developer needs to see), while the 403 / 401 / 404
 * paths pass true, since nothing else claimed it there: their trigger is a
 * control-flow sentinel, which is never reported.
