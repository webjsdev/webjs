 * `importmap.js` derives one importmap line per exported subpath
 * directly from the package's own `exports` field.
 *
 * The `'@webjsdev/core/'` prefix entry is here so that `extractPackageName`
 * returning the bare name is enough to recognise core-subpath imports
 * (`@webjsdev/core/directives`, `@webjsdev/core/task`, …) and skip
 * them; the prefix form catches anything whose extractPackageName
 * returns null but whose specifier starts with the prefix. Same
 * mechanism, no special casing per subpath.

/**
 * Bare npm specifiers that could reach the browser, filtered of the framework

 * The scan is ROOTED IN THE MODULE GRAPH, not in a filesystem walk. Only files
 * reachable from a browser-bound entry (page / layout / error / loading /
 * not-found / forbidden / unauthorized / instrumentation-client / any
 * component) contribute, which is the same authorization gate the dev server
 * uses to decide what it will serve at all. A file nothing imports contributes
 * nothing, so a build script under `scripts/`, a tooling config, a test helper
 * and an unreferenced module all drop out by reachability rather than by name
 * (there is no exclusion LIST any more, which is the point: the old one was
 * open-ended and went stale).
 *
 * Excluded on top of unreachability:
 *   - `.server.{js,ts,mjs,mts}` files. They are REACHED (the browser fetches an
 *     RPC or throw-at-load stub at that URL) but their source never ships, so
 *     their bare imports must not enter the importmap.
 *   - `@webjsdev/core` and its subpaths (BUILTIN, served locally).
 *   - `@webjsdev/cli` / `@webjsdev/server` / `@webjsdev/mcp` (#713).
 *   - `import type` statements and any `import` written inside a comment,
 *     string, template literal or regex body. Both come free from the module
 *     graph's blanked-mask scanner (#753 / #805); this function no longer has
 *     a scanner of its own.
 *
 * This is the OUT-OF-PROCESS entry point (`pinAll`, `webjs doctor`). It builds
 * its own graph, route table and component scan, roughly 70-200ms on the
 * in-repo apps, and applies NO elision pruning, so the result is a SUPERSET of
 * what the running server serves. That superset relation is what lets
 * `prunePinToReachable` intersect a committed pin down to the runtime answer
 * (#197). The dev server calls `reachedBareImports` instead, with the graph it
 * already has and its elision skip set.
