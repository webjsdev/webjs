 * The per-package-isolation property is PRESERVED as a fallback only: if
 * the unified call fails because some install is unresolvable (a 401 for a
 * private / server-only dep), one bad install must not collapse the map
 * for the rest. So:
 *   1. Try the unified call. On success, return its coherent graph.

 *      to learn which ones resolve, then RE-RUN the unified call over only
 *      the resolvable subset so the survivors stay mutually consistent.
 *      Only installs whose probe fails PERMANENTLY drop out (genuinely
 *      unresolvable, the browser never fetched them anyway); if any probe
 *      fails TRANSIENTLY, no one is dropped and the resolve is flagged for
 *      retry, so a network blip mid-probe cannot evict a good package. If
 *      the re-run itself fails, fall back to the merged per-install
 *      fragments so the app is no worse off than pre-#446.
 *   3. On a TRANSIENT failure (network / timeout / 5xx / 429), set the
