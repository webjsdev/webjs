/**
 * Secure-by-default response headers plus a small declarative per-path
 * header config (issue #232).
 *
 * WebJs sets a baseline of standard security headers on every document
 * and asset response, so a scaffolded app is not clickjackable or
 * MIME-sniffable out of the box (no reverse proxy required for the
 * baseline). The defaults are LITERAL HTTP headers, no abstraction.
 *
 * An app can ADD, OVERRIDE, or DISABLE any header per path via a
 * declarative config (`package.json` -> `webjs.headers`), shaped like
 * Next's: an array of `{ source, headers: [{ key, value }] }` where
 * `source` is a path pattern matched with the native URLPattern API.
 *
 * Precedence, lowest to highest:
 *   1. secure defaults
 *   2. path config (webjs.headers)        overrides/adds/removes a default
 *   3. app middleware (already on the Response when we merge)
 *
 * In other words middleware wins over the path config, which wins over
 * the defaults. We only ever ADD a header the response does not already
 * carry, so a header an app set (in middleware, a route handler, or via
 * `expose`) is never clobbered. A path-config entry with a null/empty
 * value REMOVES a header (e.g. drop a default on a public embed route).
 *
 * This is the connective tissue #233 (CSP) and #234 (CORS) plug into
 * later: the merge seam (applySecurityHeaders) is the single place a
 * future per-path policy layers onto a Response, so neither needs to
 * touch the response pipeline again.
