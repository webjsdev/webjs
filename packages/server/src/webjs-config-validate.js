/**
 * Boot-time validation of the app's `webjs` package.json block (#1300).
 *
 * `webjs-config.schema.json` used to reach users through exactly one wire, the
 * scaffold's `.vscode/settings.json` `$ref`, so a typo'd key was caught only for
 * a VS Code user with `package.json` open. Everywhere else the key was silently
 * dropped and the feature stayed at its default with no diagnostic, which is the
 * exact gap the `WebjsConfig` type's own docblock claims to close.
 *
 * The validator now also runs at boot, from `createRequestHandler`, so `webjs
 * dev`, `webjs start`, and an embedded host all get it from one call site.
 *
 * IT WARNS, NEVER THROWS. A typo costs one feature sitting at its default; a
 * hard boot failure over a schema quibble costs the whole app, on a deploy, at
 * the worst possible moment. That is also Next's posture (unknown and invalid
 * options warn and the boot continues, only required or migrated options are
 * fatal), and WebJs has no required keys at all since every one is optional with
 * a default.
 *
 * This is deliberately SEPARATE from `readDoctorPolicy`'s hand-written
 * `webjs.doctor.gate` validation in the CLI (#1257), which stays. That one runs
 * where `@webjsdev/server` may not resolve (#954), checks gate keys against the
 * real `DOCTOR_CODES` set (membership this schema cannot express), and fails
 * CLOSED because a silently-ignored gate leaves CI un-gated while the
 * package.json looks gated. One function cannot honour both failure modes, so
 * do not "clean up" the apparent duplication.
 *
 * Depth stays at the top level on purpose: key membership, `enum`, and
 * `boolean` / `integer` leaves. Descending into nested objects would have to
 * reckon with the free-form `headers`, `redirects`, and `csp` shapes, which is a
 * behaviour change of its own with real false-positive risk, so `webjs.dev.beforee`
 * stays uncaught for now.

/**
 * A tiny structural validator standing in for ajv (which the repo does not
 * ship). It checks exactly three things and no others: key membership under
 * `additionalProperties: false`, `enum` membership, and the `boolean` /
 * `integer` leaf types.
 *
 * So a value is type-checked only when its schema declares `type: "boolean"` or
 * `type: "integer"`, or an `enum`. Today that is 9 of the 18 top-level keys; the
 * other 9 (`headers`, `redirects`, `allowedOrigins`, `basePath`, `csp`, `dev`,
 * `start`, `db`, `doctor`) pass whatever they hold, `csp` because its schema is a
 * `oneOf` with no `type` at all and the rest because theirs is `array`,
 * `string`, or `object`. That is enough for the case this exists to close, a
 * typo'd top-level key silently dropped, plus the leaf kinds a schema can decide
 * unambiguously.
 *
 * Describe this by what it checks. Do not describe it by what a reader does
 * with a value this passes over, which varies per reader and per branch within
 * one reader and is wrong somewhere as soon as it is summarized.
 *
 * @param {Record<string, unknown>} schema the webjs-block schema
 * @param {Record<string, unknown>} value a candidate `webjs` object
 * @returns {string[]} a list of validation errors (empty = valid)
