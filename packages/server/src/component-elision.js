/**
 * Static analyser deciding whether a WebJs component module can be
 * ELIDED from the browser, that is, never downloaded as JS because its
 * SSR'd HTML is the complete, final output and the component does no
 * client-side work.
 *
 * Direction of safety: a false "interactive" verdict only costs a
 * missed optimization (we ship a module we could have skipped). A false
 * "display-only" verdict BREAKS the page (an interactive component never
 * boots). So every ambiguity resolves to "interactive / ship". The
 * analyser is a DENYLIST of interactivity signals; anything it does not
 * recognise ships by default.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR INTERACTIVITY SIGNALS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The exported constants below (REACTIVE_IMPORTS, CLIENT_LIFECYCLE_HOOKS,
 * CLIENT_METHOD_CALLS) ARE the contract. When the framework gains a new
 * interactivity feature (a new lifecycle hook, a new reactive primitive,
 * a new client-only directive, a new event-binding syntax), the marker
 * for it MUST be added to the matching list here, or the analyser will
 * wrongly elide components that use it.
 *
 * This is enforced two ways:
 *   1. The guard test in test/elision/lifecycle-coverage.test.js
 *      introspects the live framework surface and fails on drift:
 *      it enumerates every overridable WebComponent hook (each must flip
 *      a component to interactive), classifies every @webjsdev/core/
 *      directives export as client-only or render-time (a new directive
 *      fails the test until classified), and checks that no
 *      REACTIVE_IMPORTS entry is stale. Adding an interactivity surface
 *      without updating these lists fails that test.
 *   2. Maintainer pointers route changes back here: invariant 6 in
 *      packages/core/AGENTS.md and the MAINTAINER NOTE on the
 *      WebComponent lifecycle in packages/core/src/component.js both
 *      direct anyone adding an interactivity surface to update these
 *      lists, since WebJs development is largely AI-agent driven.

 * the modulepreload hint only parallelises that fetch.
 *
 * ONLY side-effect imports (`import './x'`) are stripped. A binding
 * import (`import { X } from './x'`) is left intact: its binding may be
 * used as a value at runtime, so removing it would break the module.
 * That is also why eliding stays correct, an elidable component is one
 * used purely as an SSR'd tag, never as an imported value.
 *
 * Fast path: if the importer has no elidable dependency in the graph,
 * the source is returned untouched without any regex work.
 *
 * Matching runs over a REDACTED copy (comment / string / template bodies
 * blanked, positions preserved) so a line that merely reads like an
 * import inside an `html\`...\`` template or a comment is never rewritten.
 * Real top-level import statements survive redaction; the quoted
