The developer believes they exposed an action; nothing did, and the failure only surfaces as a 404 / undefined at the first call site. This is the complement of `use-server-needs-extension` (the directive without the extension) and of `one-action-per-configured-file` (more than one action in a configured file); this rule catches the directive-present-but-nothing-callable case. The rule asserts only that the file exports at least one callable, NOT that the action returns a value (a server action may be a void side-effect or throw `redirect()` / `notFound()` and never return). Conservative: a re-export (`export ... from`, `export *`) or an `export const NAME = <identifier-or-call>` (a possible factory-produced function such as `export const get = cache(fetch)`) is treated as a possible callable and NOT flagged, so the rule fires only when every export is provably non-callable.

The server module is replaced by a stub in the browser, so the import is fine while the module never loads client-side: a display-only page is elided, and a page whose only client relevance is importing shipping components is import-only (#605/#963), dropped from the boot in favour of its components. But the moment the page does its OWN client work (the client router, a reactive primitive, a module-scope browser-global access, a client-effecting non-component util) it ships whole, dragging the server import with it. The stub then throws (or a server-only export like `auth` is missing) the instant the module loads, a runtime browser crash that `webjs typecheck` and the rest of `webjs check` miss. The rule reuses the build\'s own elision verdict, so it ONLY fires on modules that genuinely ship; an elided, inert, or import-only page is never flagged. The fix is to keep the server call off the browser-shipped module: gate the route in `middleware.ts`, call the server through a `\'use server\'` action, or move the module\'s own client work into a component so the page is dropped again. Server-to-server imports (`.server.ts` importing `.server.ts`) and `middleware.ts` / `route.ts` (never shipped) are never flagged.',

This is the runtime-crash class `check` exists to catch, filling that gap so an agent running only `check` cannot ship a broken import. Deliberately conservative to never false-positive on a valid app: it only inspects app-internal specifiers (a relative `./` path or a `#` alias) that resolve to a file in the app, only NAMED value imports (a `type` import, a default import, a namespace import, and any bare / `node:` / npm-package specifier are skipped), and it treats a module as UNKNOWABLE (never flags imports from it) when its exports are not fully enumerable: a `export * from ...` star re-export, a destructuring `export const { a } = ...`, or a multi-declarator `export const a = .., b = ..`. It reads names from `export function/class/const/let/var/type/interface/enum` and from `export { a, b as c }` / `export { x } from ...` clauses (the alias after `as` is the exported name). A re-export barrel therefore resolves correctly, and a `\'use server\'` action file exports its function names normally.

/**
 * Implements `no-server-import-in-browser-module`. Factored into its own
 * function (rather than an inline block) because it does the heavier
 * whole-app analysis the other rules avoid: it builds the module graph,
 * scans components, builds the route table, and runs the framework's own
 * elision analysis so the rule's notion of "ships to the browser" is
 * byte-for-byte the build's.
 *
 * A module is flagged when BOTH hold:
 *   1. It SHIPS to the browser. For a component that means it is NOT in the
 *      elidable set; for a page / layout that means it is NOT in the inert
 *      route-module set. (Pages and layouts that do real client work are not
 *      inert and therefore ship.)
 *   2. Its transitive import closure reaches a `.server.{ts,js}` module.
 *      `transitiveDeps` stops AT a server file (it is included but not walked
 *      into), so a server file pulled in only through another server file is
 *      not attributed to a browser module that never reaches it directly.
 *
 * Also flagged: error / loading / not-found modules. These ship to the browser
 * too (the dev server's `computeBrowserBoundFiles` adds them unconditionally)
 * and are never elided, so a server import reaching one of them is the same
 * throw-at-load crash.
 *
 * Never flagged: a `.server.ts` importing another `.server.ts` (server-to-
 * server, and `.server.*` modules are not components nor route modules), and
 * `middleware.ts` / `route.ts` (server-only, never page/layout/component
 * entries, so they are not in the candidate set to begin with).
 *
 * Scope note for dynamic imports: a string-literal `import('./widget.ts')` IS
 * tracked by the module graph now (#751), but only as a GATE edge (so the
 * lazily-imported module is servable); this rule's server-import detection
 * still runs over STATIC edges only (`transitiveDeps`), so a dynamic
 * `import('./x.server.ts')` of a no-`'use server'` utility is not flagged here.
 * That is deliberate: the throw-at-load crash is deferred to call time (when
 * the module is actually fetched), not module load, and a dynamic import is
 * also not elided framework-wide. A computed `import(expr)` cannot be resolved
 * statically at all; rather than a false-positive-prone check rule (a computed
 * import of an npm specifier or an otherwise-reachable app module is perfectly
 * valid, so it fails the check-is-correctness-only dividing line), the dev
 * server surfaces it with a 404 hint when the target 404s (see dev.js #751).
