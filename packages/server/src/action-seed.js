/**
 * The `'use server'` module load hook: action IDENTITY (#1155) and SSR
 * action-result seeding (#472, follow-up to async render #469).
 *
 * Two jobs share ONE hook because they need the same thing, a handle on every
 * exported action function at the moment its module loads, and installing two
 * hooks to get it twice would be pure cost.
 *
 * They are gated differently, and that difference is the point. SEEDING is an
 * optimization an app can switch off (`webjs.seed: false` / `WEBJS_SEED=0`).
 * IDENTITY is not optional: it is what lets `<form action=${action}>` resolve
 * to something the server can run, so a seeding-disabled app would otherwise
 * have every no-JS form silently stop working. So the hook installs
 * unconditionally and only the seed COLLECTION is gated.
 *
 * When a component's `async render()` does a bare `const u = await getUser(id)`
 * during SSR, the action runs server-side and its result is baked into the
 * first paint. On HYDRATION the client re-runs `async render()`, which re-calls
 * the action over RPC. Stale-while-revalidate (#470) hides the flicker, but the
 * redundant round-trip still happens once per async component on first load.
 *
 * This module captures each `'use server'` action result invoked DURING SSR and
 * serializes it into the page (one `<script type="application/json">` block).
 * The generated client RPC stub (`actions.js`) reads that seed on its FIRST call
 * with matching args and resolves without the RPC; a later refetch / arg-change
 * goes to the network as normal.
 *
 * ## How the capture works (no source transform, no build step)
 *
 * The framework promise is "what you write is what you see in the browser source
 * tab", not "what you write is the exact function object that runs server-side"
 * (the RPC stub already replaces the action on the client). So we install a
 * SERVER-SIDE transparent facade at module load: for a `'use server'`
 * `*.server.*` module, the load hook returns a facade that re-exports each
 * function wrapped in a `Proxy`. The Proxy records `(file, fn, args) -> result`
 * into an ambient `AsyncLocalStorage` collector WHENEVER a collector is active,
 * and is a pure passthrough otherwise.
 *
 * The facade SOURCE and the wrapping (`__actionWrap`, `buildSeedFacade`) are
 * runtime-neutral; only the INSTALL mechanism differs by runtime (`#529`), chosen
 * by `serverRuntime()`: Node uses the synchronous `module.registerHooks` load
 * hook (Node 24+, main-thread); Bun uses a `Bun.plugin` `onLoad` (Bun has no
 * `module.registerHooks`). Both feed the same `AsyncLocalStorage` collector and
 * emit the same seed wire, so a page seeds identically on either runtime.
 *
 * Recording is gated entirely by the ALS collector, which is established ONLY
 * around the SSR page render (`collectSeeds`). The RPC endpoint path runs with
 * NO collector, so the Proxy is a transparent passthrough there. The browser
 * NEVER sees this module (it sees the RPC stub), and the on-disk source is
 * unchanged, so the source-fidelity promise holds.
 *
 * ## Safety
 *
 * A key HIT returns the exact SSR value (correct by construction); a key MISS
 * degrades to a normal RPC (never wrong data, only a missed optimization). The
 * whole feature is therefore fail-open: any failure in the hook, the facade, or
 * the serializer simply skips seeding and the client re-fetches as before.
 *
 * Disabled by default-off of the flag removes the hook entirely, so module
 * loading is byte-identical to before the feature.

/**
 * Extract the names of every named export from an action module's source, split

 * simply is not wrapped (no seed for it, RPC fallback). A `export *` re-export
 * cannot be enumerated statically and is not reported here: the facade
 * re-exports it wholesale through its own `export * from` catch-all (#538), so
 * nothing about it needs a decision.
 *
 * ## Why the split matters, and which way to guess
 *
 * The two buckets get structurally different facade code, and each is wrong for
 * the other's members in a DIFFERENT way, so the fallback direction is a real
 * decision rather than a detail:
 *
 *  - `fnNames` emits a hoisted `export function n(...)`. Hoisting is what makes
 *    a circular re-export between two `'use server'` modules load (#1208), but
 *    a VALUE emitted this way is silently handed to importers as a callable.
 *  - `valNames` emits `export const n = __w(...)`. Correct for any value, but a
 *    `const` is in TDZ until the facade body runs, so a FUNCTION emitted this
 *    way re-breaks the #1208 cycle.
 *
 * The two export FORMS are therefore defaulted in opposite directions, because
 * each starts from a different prior:
 *
 *  - An `export { ... }` LIST is the cycle-critical form: its local may not be
 *    declared in this file at all (`export { helper } from './c2.server.js'` is
 *    the #1208 fixture). So a listed name is demoted to a value only on POSITIVE
 *    evidence (a literal / object / array / `new` / tagged-template right-hand
 *    side, or a `class`), and anything undecidable stays a function.
 *  - A direct `export const` always HAS its initializer right here, and is much
 *    more often a genuine value, so it defaults to `valNames` and is promoted to
 *    `fnNames` only on positive function evidence.
 *
 * Both residues are wrong in the value-as-function direction and both PREDATE
 * this split, so it is a strict improvement rather than a new trade, but neither
 * is eliminated. A list-exported name whose right-hand side is computed rather
 * than literal (`const limit = Number(env.L)`, `const x = cond ? a : b`,
 * `const x = someCall()`, or a value whose TS annotation contains a generic
 * comma, which splits the declarator) is still emitted as a function. And a
 * direct `export const` whose right-hand side is a call (`export const post =
 * withAuth(...)`) is still emitted as a `const`, so it keeps the TDZ exposure in
 * a circular import that every direct value export has always had.
 *
 * Scanning runs over a REDACTED copy (string / template / regex / comment bodies
 * blanked by the shared `js-scan` lexer), so a `const` written in a doc comment
 * or quoted in a string cannot register as a real declaration.
 *
 * @param {string} src
