/**
 * NativeSelect: styled native `<select>`. Tier-1 class helpers. Uses
 * `appearance: none` to hide the platform chevron and overlays an SVG
 * chevron on top. Best mobile UX (native picker), full keyboard support,
 * form submission works natively. No JS.
 *
 * shadcn parity:
 *   NativeSelect             → nativeSelectClass()
 *   NativeSelect wrapper     → nativeSelectWrapperClass()
 *   NativeSelect chevron     → nativeSelectIconClass()
 *   NativeSelect option      → bare <option> (or nativeSelectOptionClass()
 *                              for explicit overrides, since the theme
 *                              stylesheet sets Canvas / CanvasText on
 *                              every <option> automatically)
 *
 * The theme stylesheet forces Canvas / CanvasText on every <option> so the
 * dropdown reads in both light and dark themes regardless of OS preference.
 * It arrives with the design tokens (`npx @webjsdev/ui init`, or `add`, which
 * writes the block when it is missing), so it is in the first paint and works
 * with JavaScript off. Advanced overrides use `nativeSelectOptionClass()` and
 * `nativeSelectOptGroupClass()`.
 *
 * Design tokens used: --input, --background, --primary, --primary-foreground,
 * --muted-foreground, --ring, --destructive.
 *
 * A11y (required for accessible output):
 *   LABEL IT. A `<label class=${labelClass()} for="<the select's id">` linked by
 *   the `for` / `id` pair is the whole requirement. A `<select>` with no label
 *   announces only its current value, so the user hears "Basic" with no idea it
 *   is the billing plan.
 *   The chevron is DECORATIVE and must stay `aria-hidden="true"`. It duplicates
 *   information the select's own role already conveys, and it sits outside the
 *   control, so without the attribute it is announced as a stray graphic.
 *   There is no placeholder option in a `<select>`. If you need one, use a
 *   `<option value="" disabled selected>` prompt, and keep `required` on the
 *   select so an empty submit is caught natively.
 *   Group long option lists with `<optgroup label="...">`; the label is
 *   announced, so it is real structure rather than only a visual break.
 *   Being native is the accessibility win here: the platform picker, the
 *   keyboard behaviour, and the mobile UX come for free. Do not rebuild it as a
 *   div-based listbox to gain styling.
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <div class=${fieldClass()}>
 *   <label class=${labelClass()} for="plan">Billing plan</label>
 *   <div class=${nativeSelectWrapperClass()}>
 *     <select class=${nativeSelectClass()} name="plan" id="plan" required>
 *       <option value="" disabled selected>Choose a plan</option>
 *       <option value="basic">Basic</option>
 *       <option value="pro">Pro</option>
 *     </select>
 *     <!-- chevron icon, decorative -->
 *     <svg class="${nativeSelectIconClass()}" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="m6 9 6 6 6-6" /></svg>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
