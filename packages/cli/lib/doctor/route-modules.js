 * documented `"myapp"`, `"/myapp"` and `"/myapp/"` all normalize alike), and
 * fails safe to `''` on a value that is not a plain same-origin prefix. Reading
 * only `startsWith('/')` would leave this check inert for an app configured
 * `"myapp"`, which is exactly the silently-inert case it exists to close.
 *
 * Ported rather than imported because that helper is not on `@webjsdev/server`'s
 * public surface, and because doctor must stay usable when the framework does
 * not resolve from the app dir at all (the #954 fresh-worktree case this same
 * command exists to diagnose). The port is intentional and stays. What makes it
 * safe is that the drift is tested rather than trusted.

 * function and the server's `readBasePath`, asserting they agree with each other
 * and with the expected value. Change either side without the other and it reds.
 * So edit this body only alongside `packages/server/src/base-path.js`, and run
 * that test. (`test/cli/doctor.test.mjs` covers the check that consumes this,
 * not the normalization forms themselves.)
