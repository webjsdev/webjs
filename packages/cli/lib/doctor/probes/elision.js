 * Advisory (#646): name why a page/layout SHIPS its module to the browser
 * instead of being elided. A page/layout that is a pure carrier (import-only
 * #605 / inert #179) stays out of the browser; one that ships whole is pinned
 * by a specific client-effecting NON-component on a component-free path from it, #963 (a util touching
 * a client global, a module-scope side effect, a bare side-effect import) or by
 * its own client work. This turns that invisible #605/#179 regression into a
 * named line. WARN only: a page legitimately MAY ship, and the analyser is
 * biased toward shipping by design (server AGENTS invariant 7), so this is a
 * "you may not have intended this" hint, never a hard fail.
 * @param {Promise<any|null>} elisionPromise  the ONE shared report (#1308)

/**
 * The OTHER direction of the elision verdict (#1308): which COMPONENT modules
 * the browser never downloads. `checkElisionCarriers` above reports the benign
 * over-ship direction; this one reports what was DROPPED, which is where a
 * wrong verdict silently costs an app its interactivity.
 *
 * Pass-only except for orphans, deliberately. An elided component is the
 * DESIRED outcome, so warning on one would fire on every healthy app and train
 * the reader to skip doctor output. The passing message carries the elided
 * inventory instead, which makes it the discovery surface, while `webjs
 * elision` is the detail surface. The one always-wrong condition is an ORPHAN:
 * a `class X extends WebComponent` with no literal-tag registration is
 * invisible to the scanner, so it gets no verdict at all and `static
 * interactive = true` cannot rescue it (nothing consults the component
 * analyser for a component the scanner never saw). Never `fail`:
 * an app that wants an orphan to break CI gates `ELISION_COMPONENTS` to
 * `error` via `webjs.doctor.gate`.
