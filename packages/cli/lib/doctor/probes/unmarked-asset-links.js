 * Whether a parsed `<link>` is an unmarked stylesheet, and if so its href.

 * the tag matches the string inside ANOTHER attribute's value, which flags the
 * two shapes this check most needs to leave alone: the canonical async-CSS
 * `<link rel="preload" as="style" href="/app.css" onload="this.rel='stylesheet'">`
 * (where the advised `asset()` fix would actively BREAK the preload, since the
 * versioned hint could then never match the unversioned request), and a
 * `data-rel="stylesheet"` sitting on a `rel="icon"`. Reading real attributes
 * makes `rel` mean the `rel` attribute and nothing else.
 *
 * Returns the href only when every condition holds:
 *   - `rel` is a token list CONTAINING `stylesheet` (so `rel="preload"` with an
 *     onload swap, and `rel="icon"`, are both out).
 *   - `href` is QUOTED. An unquoted value is a template hole
 *     (`href=${asset('/app.css')}`), undecidable from source, and is
 *     exactly the shape the marked form uses.
 *   - the path names a file under `public/` (served at the url root, after the app's `webjs.basePath` is
 *     stripped, since under a sub-path deploy the author writes the prefix
 *     themselves and `resolveAssetUrl` strips it before its own `public/` gate).
 *   - `resolveAssetUrl` would actually fingerprint it. It returns a path
 *     carrying a QUERY or a `..` unchanged, so wrapping one in `asset()` is a
 *     runtime NO-OP: the author does the work and the url they ship is
 *     byte-identical. Advising it would be advising a change that buys nothing.
 *     A hand-rolled `?v=` cache-buster is exactly what an author who has not
 *     adopted `asset()` is most likely to have written, so this is the common
 *     case, not a corner. (The warning itself would clear, since this check
 *     reads the SOURCE shape and a wrapped href is an unquoted hole. Clearing a
 *     warning without improving the caching is the outcome to avoid.)

/**
 * ADVISORY (#1095): a route module hand-writes a `<link rel="stylesheet"
 * href="/app.css">` without `asset()`, so the url is un-versioned and a deploy
 * cannot bust a CDN's copy of it.
 *
 * The failure this names was caught in production on webjs.dev: the edge served
 * a `public/tailwind.css` built BEFORE the deploy (`cf-cache-status: HIT`,
 * `max-age=14400`) against post-deploy HTML, so the new page rendered with its
 * content edge to edge and its grid collapsed, because the cached css was
 * missing the arbitrary-value utilities that page introduced. It is invisible
 * while a deploy only restyles existing classes and maximally visible the moment
 * one adds a page using new utilities.
 *
 * Why this is an ADVISORY over the author's SOURCE rather than a rewrite of the
 * framework's OUTPUT. The first attempt at the automatic form (#1196) matched
 * urls in the assembled HTML, and two deep-review rounds found six major
 * defects, five of them one bug: at that layer framework output and author data
 * are indistinguishable, so the matcher kept editing things it did not own. That
 * is why `asset()` (#1194) is opt-in, and it is what Rails (a
 * `stylesheet_link_tag` helper over a digest manifest) and Remix (a hashed url
 * from the build graph, surfaced through `links()`) both do: take the
 * fingerprint from an authoritative source at the point the url is PRODUCED, and
 * never rewrite a rendered document. The gap `asset()` leaves is purely
 * ergonomic. In Rails the helper is the only idiomatic way to write the tag, so
 * forgetting it is nearly impossible; in WebJs the `<link>` is hand-written HTML,
 * so it is easy to omit. This check closes exactly that gap, at authoring time,
 * where the author's meaning is unambiguous and nothing is rewritten.
 *
 * Scoped to `rel="stylesheet"` on purpose. An icon is a legitimate deliberate
 * NON-mark (the website leaves its favicons bare so the SEO repo-health tests
 * can parse the hrefs literally), and a `rel="preload"` must NOT be marked at
 * all, since its versioned hint could never match the unversioned request a CSS
 * `url()` actually makes. Flagging either would nag about a correct choice.
 *
 * WARN only: an un-versioned stylesheet still SERVES correctly, it just caches
 * badly, and an app fronted by no CDN may not care.
 * @param {string} appDir
 * @returns {Promise<DoctorResult>}
