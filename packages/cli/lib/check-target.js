/**
 * `webjs check` invocation-target guard (#1301).
 *
 * `webjs check` is an APP-level tool: every rule assumes one application,
 * meaning one module graph, one custom-element registry, one runtime. Run at a
 * workspace root it walks whatever JS/TS happens to live under that path (two
 * apps, every package's test suite, editor fixtures, the scaffold templates)
 * and reports collisions no single runtime ever sees. At this repo's root that
 * was 67 findings, all false.
 *
 * The predicate is the presence of an `app/` directory, nothing else. That is
 * the same test `check.js` already applies per-rule, `app/` cannot be renamed
 * (AGENTS.md "App layout"), and BOTH scaffold templates create it. Next.js
 * refuses on the identical predicate in
 * `packages/next/src/lib/find-pages-dir.ts`. A `workspaces` key is NOT part of
 * the predicate (a directory with no `app/` is not an app either way); it only
 * enriches the MESSAGE with the member apps to run instead.
 *
 * PURE apart from directory reads: it never prints and never exits. The bin
 * owns rendering and the exit code.
 *
 * @module check-target
