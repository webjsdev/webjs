// The no-JS write path for the todo forms. Every <form> in <todo-app> binds
// THIS action, and the submit button's own `name="intent"` says which mutation
// to run, which is how one form serves several buttons.
//
// Why an intent dispatcher here rather than binding each button to its own
// action: this form carries the todo's `id` on a hidden input and needs the
// SAME id for whichever mutation runs, so one action reading both fields is the
// simpler shape. When the buttons need no shared payload, bind each one
// directly instead, with `formaction=${action}` on a <button> inside the bound
// form. The identity then rides that button's own name/value pair, so it works
// with JS off too. Two things to know: it must be a <button> (on an
// <input type="submit"> the identity would occupy `value`, which is also that
// control's visible label), and a bound submitter cannot carry its own
// `name`/`value`, which is exactly the channel `name="intent"` uses below.
//
// Third thing to know, and the one that fails silently: the enclosing <form>
// has to be bound too, because `method="post"` and the enctype are supplied on
// the form's start tag and a per-button action cannot retrofit them. The
// renderer refuses an unbound form it can see, but a submitter inside a
// COMPONENT is a cannot-tell (the component renders in its own pass with no
// view of the host page) and binds anyway. What happens then depends on that
// form: one still declaring `method="post"` works (the identity rides the
// button's own name/value pair into the body), but one with no method submits as
// a GET, so the identity rides the query string and the action never runs while
// the page returns 200. Run `webjs check`: `submitter-needs-bound-form` finds
// these across modules.
//
// With JS the component intercepts the submit and calls the underlying action
// directly for the optimistic path, so this runs only with JS off.
