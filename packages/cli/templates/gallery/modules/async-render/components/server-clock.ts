// async render() awaits server data directly in the leaf component. Three
// decoupled concerns to know (see AGENTS.md "Async render"):
//   1. SSR always BLOCKS, so the resolved data is in the first paint with no
//      fallback markup (progressive-enhancement safe, readable with JS off).
//   2. The client re-fetch default is stale-while-revalidate (old content stays
//      until the new render resolves, no blank flash).
//   3. renderFallback() is the OPTIONAL re-fetch loading UI, never first paint.
// Reach for async render() when request-time SERVER data belongs in the first
// paint; reach for a Task / signals for genuinely client-only data.

  // re-fetch. This is the common fetch-and-display leaf shape. If you ever need
