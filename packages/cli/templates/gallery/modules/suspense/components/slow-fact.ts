// A bare async-render component whose server data is deliberately SLOW. On its
// own, async render() BLOCKS the SSR first byte (the resolved value lands in the
// first paint with no fallback, which is what the async-render demo shows). That
// is the right default for fast data. Here the data is slow, so the page wraps
// it in a <webjs-suspense> boundary that flushes its fallback on the first byte
// and STREAMS this content in when the await settles (progressively on soft
// navigation too). Same component either way; the boundary is what changes the
// SSR behaviour from block to stream.
