## Build a full-stack app (default template)

This scaffold ships a browsable feature gallery to learn from: single-concept
demos under `app/features/`, the `app/examples/todo` app, and an example design
system under `components/ui/`, with logic in `modules/`. Build in this order.

### 1. Study the gallery, then clear it

Read the demos under `app/features/` (and `app/examples/todo`) that match what
you are building, so you copy the real idiom: server actions, queries,
optimistic UI, component hydration, design tokens. Then run
`npm run gallery:clear` to shed the whole gallery and reset `app/page.ts` and
`app/layout.ts` to a blank slate. The skill teaches the same patterns and
survives the clear, so the gallery is a runnable copy you study first, not
something you lose.

### 2. Build a token-based design system first

Define your color tokens as CSS custom properties in `app/layout.ts`, each
written once with the native CSS `light-dark(LIGHT, DARK)` function so light and
dark modes come from ONE declaration: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`,
`--primary`, `--secondary`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--border`, `--ring`,
`--destructive`. Consume them ONLY as token utilities (`bg-background`,
`text-foreground`, `bg-card`, `border-border`, `text-primary`,
`text-muted-foreground`, `bg-destructive`). Never put a raw un-themed Tailwind
color (`red-500`, `blue-600`, `gray-100`) on an element or a `@webjsdev/ui`
helper. Add an inline theme-detection script in the layout `<head>` so the first
paint matches the saved theme with no flash. Full reference:
`.agents/skills/webjs/references/styling.md`.

### 3. Use the UI kit, do not hand-roll primitives

Pull primitives with `npx webjsdev ui add <name>`; the source is copied into
`components/ui/`, so you own and theme it. Do NOT guess a helper or tag
signature. Inspect the copied file `components/ui/<name>.ts`, or run
`npx webjsdev ui view <name>`, for the exact exported names, variants, and
sizes. The kit has two tiers:

- **Tier 1, class helpers** for static primitives (button, card, input, badge,
  select, textarea). Spread the helper onto a native element, for example
  `class=${buttonClass({ variant: 'primary', size: 'md' })}`.
- **Tier 2, custom elements** for stateful controls and overlays (`<ui-tabs>`,
  `<ui-dialog>`, `<ui-dropdown-menu>`, `<ui-tooltip>`, sonner toasts). Use the
  registered tag; it owns its ARIA, focus trap, and keyboard navigation out of
  the box. Never hand-author a tab strip or a modal when a Tier-2 element
  covers it.

Full reference: `.agents/skills/webjs/references/ui-kit.md`.

### 4. Build a multi-page app (MPA), not a single page

Structure the product as real routes, not one page that swaps client state:

- `/` a home or overview page.
- `/<resource>` a list page with search, filters, sorting, and a create form or
  modal.
- `/<resource>/[id]` a detail page for one item.
- a couple of additional feature pages as the product needs.

Give `app/layout.ts` a navbar that links the main pages, pinned with
`position: fixed` (never `position: sticky`, which flickers on iOS during a
client-router navigation), and reserve its height on the content with a
`--header-height` offset. In a list or table, clicking a row or card navigates
to that item's detail page. Wrap each row action button (edit, delete, status)
so its handler calls `event.stopPropagation()`, letting the button run its own
action without also triggering the row navigation.

### 5. Verify before you call it done

Run each of these and fix what it reports, in order:

- `npx webjsdev check` (correctness: no browser-import or boundary violation).
- `npm run typecheck` (zero type errors).
- `npm test` (unit and browser tests for the features you built).
- `npm run css:build` (compile Tailwind).

Then boot `npm run dev` and confirm every page route returns HTTP 200.

### Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run gallery:clear        # shed the demo gallery before building a real app
npm run dev                  # dev server at http://localhost:8080
npm run start                # production server
npm test                     # unit + browser tests
npm run typecheck
npm run css:build            # compile Tailwind
npx webjsdev check           # correctness checks
npx webjsdev ui add <name>   # copy a ui primitive into components/ui/
npx webjsdev ui view <name>  # inspect a primitive's exact signature
npm run db:generate && npm run db:migrate
```
