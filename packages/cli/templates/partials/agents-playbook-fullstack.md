## Build a full-stack app (default template)

This scaffold ships a browsable feature gallery to learn from: single-concept
demos under `app/features/`, the `app/examples/todo` app, and an example design
system under `components/ui/`, with logic in `modules/`. Build in this order.

### 1. Study the gallery, then clear it

Read the demos under `app/features/` (and `app/examples/todo`) that match what
you are building, so you copy the real idiom: server actions, queries,
optimistic UI, component hydration, design tokens. Then run
`npm run gallery:clear` to shed the whole gallery and reset `app/page.ts` and
`app/layout.ts` to a blank slate. The clear also removes the example
`components/ui/` primitives, the demo `todos` table, and the demo migrations;
it keeps the agent skill, the database wiring, and `lib/utils/cn.ts` (needed by
`npx webjsdev ui add`). The skill teaches the same patterns, so the gallery is
a runnable copy you study first, not something you lose.

### 2. Model the data

Define real models in `db/schema.server.ts`, then run `npm run db:generate` and
`npm run db:migrate` (required after the clear, which removed the demo table and
migrations). Write a seed script at `db/seed.server.ts` and run
`npm run db:seed` so list and detail pages render real rows while you build,
instead of empty states. Put reads in `modules/<feature>/queries/*.server.ts`
and writes in `modules/<feature>/actions/*.server.ts`, one function per file.

### 3. Build a token-based design system

Full reference: `.agents/skills/webjs/references/styling.md`.

- Define your color tokens as CSS custom properties in `app/layout.ts`, each
  written ONCE with the native CSS `light-dark(LIGHT, DARK)` function, so light
  and dark modes come from one declaration.
- Define at least: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`, `--primary`,
  `--secondary`, `--muted`, `--muted-foreground`, `--accent`, `--border`,
  `--ring`, `--destructive`. Add the matching `*-foreground` pair for each
  surface token you use, following the styling guide's reference palette.
- Consume colors ONLY as token utilities: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`,
  `bg-card`, `border-border`, `text-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`,
  `bg-destructive`.
- NEVER put a raw un-themed Tailwind color (`red-500`, `blue-600`, `gray-100`)
  on an element or a `@webjsdev/ui` helper.
- Add an inline theme-detection script in the layout `<head>` so the first
  paint matches the saved theme with no flash.

### 4. Use the UI kit, do not hand-roll primitives

Pull primitives with `npx webjsdev ui add <name>`; the source is copied into
`components/ui/`, so you own it fully and can add, remove, restructure, or theme
it however your app needs. Do NOT guess a helper or tag signature. Inspect the
copied file `components/ui/<name>.ts`, or run
`npx webjsdev ui view <name>`, for the exact exported names, variants, and
sizes. The kit has two tiers:

- **Tier 1, class helpers** for static primitives (button, card, input, badge,
  native-select, textarea). Spread the helper onto a native element, for example
  `class=${buttonClass({ variant: 'outline', size: 'sm' })}`.
- **Tier 2, custom elements** for stateful controls and overlays (`<ui-tabs>`,
  `<ui-dialog>`, `<ui-dropdown-menu>`, `<ui-tooltip>`, sonner toasts). Use the
  registered tag; it owns its ARIA, focus trap, and keyboard navigation out of
  the box. Never hand-author a tab strip or a modal when a Tier-2 element
  covers it.

Full reference: `.agents/skills/webjs/references/ui-kit.md`.

### 5. Build a multi-page app (MPA), not a single page

Structure the product as real routes, not one page that swaps client state:

- `/` a home or overview page.
- `/<resource>` a list page with search, filters, sorting, and a create form or
  modal.
- `/<resource>/[id]` a detail page for one item.
- a couple of additional feature pages as the product needs.

Give `app/layout.ts` a navbar that links the main pages, pinned with
`position: fixed` (never `position: sticky`, which flickers on iOS during a
client-router navigation), and reserve its height on the content with a
`--header-height` offset. In a list or table, clicking a row or card navigates
to that item's detail page. Wrap each row action button (edit, delete, status)
so its handler calls `event.stopPropagation()`, letting the button run its own
action without also triggering the row navigation.

### 6. Build components for interactivity

Pages and layouts (`app/**/page.ts`, `app/**/layout.ts`) are server-only HTML
generators, so put every interactive behavior inside a `WebComponent` custom
element. Declare a component's reactive properties in the base-class factory,
never as a class-field initializer (`items = []` clobbers the reactive
accessor). Use the shorthand for primitives
(`extends WebComponent({ name: String, count: Number, open: Boolean })`) and the
`prop<T>()` helper for typed objects and arrays
(`extends WebComponent({ items: prop<Item[]>(Array), user: prop<User>(Object) })`).

### 7. Verify before you call it done

Run `npm run ci` and fix what it reports. It is one command for every gate,
the step list declared in `package.json` under `webjs.ci`, with a result line
per step:

- `webjs check` (correctness: no browser-import or boundary violation).
- `webjs doctor` (project health). It fails on whatever `package.json`
  `webjs.doctor.gate` marks `error`, plus the two hard toolchain checks that
  are fatal with no gate entry, `NODE_VERSION` and `TSCONFIG_ERASABLE`.
- `webjs typecheck` (zero type errors).
- A dependency audit.
- The server, browser, and e2e test layers for the features you built.

The GitHub workflow runs the same list, so a green local run predicts CI.
While iterating, `npm run ci -- --only Tests` runs one layer. Then
`npm run css:build` (compile Tailwind).

Then boot `npm run dev`, confirm every page route returns HTTP 200, and open
every route you changed in a real browser and play through its states: `check`
and `typecheck` pass even when a layout collapses, so the browser is the real
check for UI work.

### Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run gallery:clear        # shed the demo gallery before building a real app
npm run dev                  # dev server at http://localhost:8080
npm run start                # production server
npm test                     # unit + browser tests
npm run typecheck
npm run css:build            # compile Tailwind
npm run ci                   # every gate, one command (the webjs.ci steps in package.json)
npm run check                # correctness checks
npm run doctor               # project health (severity per check: webjs.doctor.gate)
npx webjsdev ui add <name>   # copy a ui primitive into components/ui/
npx webjsdev ui view <name>  # inspect a primitive's exact signature
npm run db:generate && npm run db:migrate
```
