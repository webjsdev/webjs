/**
 * Form actions: binding a `'use server'` action straight into a form (#1155),
 * and the guard that refuses every OTHER way a function could reach the markup
 * (#1154).
 *
 * ONE supported shape, and it is the shape a Next-trained author already
 * writes:
 *
 *   import { submitFeedback } from '#modules/feedback/actions/submit.server.ts';
 *   html`<form action=${submitFeedback}> ... </form>`
 *
 * The renderers do not stringify that function. They resolve its IDENTITY
 * (`<file-hash>/<export-name>`, the same naming the RPC endpoint uses), drop
 * the `action` attribute so the form posts to the page's own url, force the
 * attributes the submission needs (`method="post"`, `enctype`), and emit one
 * hidden field carrying the identity. The server resolves that field back to
 * the function and runs it. Nothing about the action's source reaches the
 * browser, and the form works with JS off because it is an ordinary HTML
 * submission.
 *
 * Every other function-in-an-action shape stays REFUSED, because it would
 * stringify the function's body into the served HTML. At SSR a `'use server'`
 * import is the REAL server function (the RPC stub only exists in the
 * browser), so a plain `String(val)` commit serializes the action's body,
 * secrets included, to every visitor. The refusal list is deliberately wider
 * than the leak: a quoted `action="${fn}"`, `?action=${fn}`, an array holding
 * a function, an unsupported `formaction=` shape, and `action=` on a tag that
 * is not a `<form>` all refuse, so there is exactly one way to write each
 * binding and no silently-broken near-miss.
 *
 * `formaction=${fn}` on a SUBMITTER is the second supported shape (#1207), for
 * a form whose buttons run different actions. The identity rides the channel a
 * browser gives only to the button that was pressed: its own `name`/`value`
 * pair. So the renderers emit `<button name="__webjs_action" value="<id>">` and
 * no `formaction` url at all, exactly as a bound `action=${fn}` emits no
 * `action`. The form-level hidden field is the form's FIRST child and SSR emits
 * it right after the start tag, so a submitter's entry necessarily follows it
 * in DOM order; the dispatcher reads `getAll(FORM_ACTION_FIELD)` and takes the
 * LAST, which is the submitter's whenever one was pressed. Nothing new is
 * needed on the JS path either: `new FormData(form, submitter)` already
 * includes the pressed button's pair.
 *
 * THE RULE, one sentence, and the whole reason this file is shaped the way it
 * is (#1307): the renderer supplies submission attributes at the level where
 * the action is BOUND, and never overrides what the author wrote at that same
 * level. A bound `<form>` gains `method="post"` and `enctype`; a bound
 * `<button>` gains `formmethod="post"` and `formenctype` ON THE BUTTON. So a
 * bound submitter is SELF-SUFFICIENT: it works inside a bound form, an unbound
 * form, a `method="get"` form, or a form with no method at all, and it asks
 * nothing of the element around it.
 *
 * That is what React does (`pushFormActionAttribute` emits `formMethod` and
 * `formEncType` beside the identity, from an action descriptor that is
 * literally `{name, method: 'POST', encType: 'multipart/form-data'}`), and it
 * is what makes the rule below possible.
 *
 * Refused shapes on a submitter, each because the identity would not arrive:
 *   - Its own `name` (static `name="..."` or a `name=${n}` hole) or its own
 *     `value`, because the identity occupies both halves of that one pair.
 *   - `<input type="image">`, which submits `name.x` / `name.y` coordinates
 *     instead of `name=value`, so the identity would never arrive.
 *   - A control that is not a submitter at all, where `formaction` is inert.
 *   - A `form="other"` attribute, which moves the submitter's form owner
 *     somewhere the identity field it needs may not be.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT REFUSED, and the line that decides it: only a SAME-ELEMENT
 * contradiction refuses, never a rule about the author's OTHER elements. A
 * same-element contradiction has no correct behaviour to fall back to (a bound
 * button that also says `formmethod="get"` cannot both run the action and send
 * no body). A cross-element rule always does have one, namely whatever native
 * HTML would have done, so the renderer honours it instead of refusing.
 *
 * The concrete consequence, and it is a deliberate reversal of #1207's Part B:
 * a PLAIN, non-binding `<button formmethod="get">` inside a bound form now
 * renders untouched. Native HTML says the submitter's override wins, an author
 * who typed it meant it, and the form's action simply does not run, which is
 * exactly what the same markup does in any other framework. The dev-time client
 * guard reports at submit time when a submission carries an identity it cannot
 * deliver, which is the right place for a judgement call about intent.
 *
 * Both SSR state machines and the client renderer import from here so the
 * rules cannot drift between them. Each renderer commits attribute, boolean
 * and property holes on separate branches, so they have more call sites than
 * it looks like from any one file and are easy to change one at a time. That
 * is why the predicates live here rather than at each site.
 *
 * Since #1646 there is ONE SSR interpreter (`render-server/walk.js`), shared
 * by the buffered page render and `renderToStream(v, { ssr: false })`, so the
 * two can no longer drift; the predicates still live here because the CLIENT
 * renderer applies the same rules.
