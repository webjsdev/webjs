/**
 * TypeScript overlay for the `webjs` config block in a WebJs app's
 * package.json.
 *
 *     // package.json is JSON, so author it there, but a typed reference
 *     // helps an agent or a human author the block correctly:
 *     import type { WebjsConfig } from '@webjsdev/core';
 *     const config: WebjsConfig = { trailingSlash: 'never', csp: true };
 *
 * This object is read key by key, mostly by the server and for a few keys
 * by the CLI. Without a type or schema a typo'd key (e.g. `redirect` for
 * `redirects`) was silently dropped and the feature stayed at its default
 * with no diagnostic. Three things close that gap now, at three different
 * moments: this type while an agent or a human authors the block, the
 * published JSON Schema in an editor via the scaffold's `.vscode` `$ref`,
 * and `webjs-config-validate.js` at BOOT (#1300), which runs that same
 * schema from `createRequestHandler` and warns once, naming every unknown
 * top-level key, every bad `enum` value, and every wrong-typed `boolean` /
 * `integer` (9 of the 17 keys). It does NOT type-check the other 8
 * (`headers`, `redirects`, `basePath`, `allowedOrigins`, `csp`, `dev`,
 * `start`, `doctor`), and it does not descend into a nested object, so a
 * misspelling inside `dev` or `start` is not reported either. Whether
 * anything else notices what this check passes over is up to the
 * individual reader. The boot check warns and never throws, so a typo
 * costs one feature its setting rather than the whole app its boot.
 *
 * LOCKSTEP: this file, the JSON Schema at
 * packages/server/webjs-config.schema.json, and the reader functions MUST
 * stay in sync, so adding a `webjs.*` key means updating all three places
 * (plus the KNOWN_KEYS drift test). The reader inventory is NOT repeated
 * here on purpose: packages/server/AGENTS.md holds the one canonical list
 * along with the procedure, and every copy of it that existed drifted.
 *
 * Every key is optional (the whole block is optional and every key has a
 * default). Zero runtime cost: nothing in this file ships to the browser.
