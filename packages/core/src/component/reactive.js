 *
 * UNCONDITIONAL, matching the `.prop=${fn}` unserializable-value drop in
 * `render-server.js`, which is the sibling path this guard mirrors. Two
 * reasons not to gate it on a dev flag. It fires only on a genuine mistake (a
 * function is never a meaningful attribute value), so there is no volume to
 * suppress, and reflection runs per assignment rather than per frame.
 *
 * More decisively, a `NODE_ENV` gate does not survive the dist build.
 * `scripts/build-framework-dist.js` runs esbuild with `platform: 'browser'`
 * and `minify: true`, which substitutes `process.env.NODE_ENV` with
 * `"production"` and folds the check to a constant. The SSR half of the
 * warning would then be unreachable in every published build, which is how
 * every installed app runs, and SSR is the half that matters most, since that

/**
 * A minimal base for HTML Custom Elements that mirrors Lit's ergonomics
 * while staying JSDoc-only and no-build.
 *
 * Subclasses declare:
 *  - reactive properties, through the `WebComponent({ ... })` factory:
 *    attribute/property declarations with type info, reflection and custom
 *    converters (internal state is an instance signal, not a property)
 *  - `static styles`: CSSResult or array thereof (only meaningful with
 *    `static shadow = true`; light-DOM components inherit global CSS)
 *  - `static shadow`: set `true` to opt in to shadow DOM (default: `false`
 *    → light DOM, so Tailwind / global CSS apply directly)
 *  - `render()`: returns a TemplateResult
 *
 * The tag name is not a static field: pass it to `.register('tag-name')`
 * at the bottom of the file. Tag must contain a hyphen (HTML spec).
 *
 * Lifecycle (lit-aligned, called in order during each update cycle):
 *  1. `shouldUpdate(changedProperties)`. Skip update if false.
 *  2. `willUpdate(changedProperties)`. Safe to set properties; folds into this cycle.
 *  3. controllers' `hostUpdate()`
 *  4. `update(changedProperties)`. Default impl calls `render()` + commits.
 *  5. controllers' `hostUpdated()`
 *  6. `firstUpdated(changedProperties)`: once, on the first render only
 *  7. `updated(changedProperties)`: every render commit
 *  8. `updateComplete` promise resolves
 *
 * `changedProperties` is a `Map<string, unknown>` where each entry maps
 * a property name to its previous value.
 *
 * MAINTAINER NOTE. Adding a new overridable lifecycle hook here means
 * the display-only component elision analyser must learn about it too,
 * or it will wrongly elide a component that now does client work. Add
 * the hook name to `CLIENT_LIFECYCLE_HOOKS` in
 * `packages/server/src/component-elision.js`. The guard test at
 * `packages/server/test/elision/lifecycle-coverage.test.js` introspects
 * this prototype and fails until you do.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```js
 * import { signal } from '@webjsdev/core';
 *
 * const count = signal(0);
 *
 * class MyCounter extends WebComponent {
 *   render() {
 *     return html`<button @click=${() => count.set(count.get() + 1)}>${count.get()}</button>`;
 *   }
 * }
 * MyCounter.register('my-counter');
 * ```
