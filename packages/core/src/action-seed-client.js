/**
 * Client-side SSR action-seed consumer (#472).
 *
 * The server (`@webjsdev/server`'s `action-seed.js`) serializes each action
 * result invoked during SSR into a `<script type="application/json"
 * id="__webjs-seeds">` block. A per-element `data-webjs-seed` carrier is also
 * READ here, for a future per-component / streamed-region seeding; no server
 * path emits one today, and a streamed render emits no seeds at all.
 * On the client, the generated RPC stub
 * (`actions.js`) calls `takeSeed(hash, fn, argsKey)` on its FIRST invocation: a
 * hit resolves the action synchronously with the SSR value (no RPC, no flicker
 * on hydration); a miss falls through to the normal RPC.
 *
 * Consume-once: a hit removes the seed, so a later refetch / arg-change always
 * goes to the network (the seed is a first-paint optimization, not a cache).
 * Keyed `hash/fn/stringify(args)`, where `hash` and `stringify` match exactly
 * what the server emitted, so distinct components and distinct args each map to
 * their own seed. A miss is always safe (it just re-fetches).
 *
 * This module is imported by the generated stub via the bare `@webjsdev/core`
 * specifier; on the server it is inert (its only DOM access is inside
 * `scanSeeds`, never called server-side).

 * that actually had one gets no report at all. Closing on the next scan bounds
 * it from both ends, and the marker rides the window for the same reason the
 * counters do.
 *
 * `epoch` lets a scheduled callback tell whether its window is still the open

  //
  // The router has to say which it is, because the parse cannot be recognised
  // from its own shape. `ssr.js` slices out a bare frame subtree ONLY when the
  // id was found and the render did not stream; in every other case it falls
  // through and serves the WHOLE PAGE, seed block and all, so a frame response
  // is not reliably distinguishable from a page that seeded nothing. Guessing
  // failed in both directions in turn: treating it as a page killed the report
  // for the whole page the frame sits on, and attributing the window to the live
  // page made it report a CAUSE that is provably false, since none of the causes
  // describes a frame response. (The response's own `X-Webjs-Seed` is no help
  // either: the isolable case returns before the header is set, and the three
  // fallthrough shapes below carry the SURROUNDING page's header, which says
  // nothing about the frame.)
  //
  // Discarding is right for every shape the fallthrough produces, and they are
  // not all the same shape:
  //  - ISOLABLE (id found, buffered): the subtree was sliced before the block
  //    was appended, so there is nothing to discard.
  //  - STREAMED: the whole page is served and the frame IS in it, so the swap
  //    SUCCEEDS. In dev the page carries a marker-only block, which holds no
  //    seeds anyway.
  //  - #241 HTML CACHE HIT: the cached page is returned before the slice, so the
  //    parse carries a real, populated block, and the swap succeeds. Those seeds
  //    describe the whole page, not the one region being swapped in, and the
  //    page on screen already has its own.
  //  - ID MISSING: the whole page is served, the router dispatches
  //    `webjs:frame-missing`, and the response is thrown away entirely.
  //
  // Ingesting in the last three would put another response's seeds in the store,
