/**
 * Client router for webjs: nested-layout-aware partial swap.
 *
 * Intercepts same-origin link clicks and form submissions, fetches the
 * target page's HTML via `fetch()`, finds the deepest layout boundary
 * shared by both the current and incoming pages, and replaces ONLY the
 * children of that boundary. Outer layout DOM (header, sidenav, footer)
 * stays mounted: no re-render, no flicker, scroll positions preserved.
 *
 * Enablement is automatic: this module calls `enableClientRouter()` at its
 * end (idempotent), and the `@webjsdev/core` browser entry loads it, so any
 * page that ships a component gets the router with no import to add. Call
 * `disableClientRouter()` to opt out, or `enableClientRouter()` for
 * programmatic control.
 *
 * Mechanism: auto-derived from folder structure (#1015):
 *   1. SSR injects KEYED boundary comment pairs around each layout's
 *      `${children}` interpolation and around the page itself:
 *      `<!--wj:children:<segment>:<route-key>-->` ... `<!--/wj:children:<segment>-->`.
 *      The close carries the segment (deterministic id-matched pairing, no
 *      LIFO), the open carries the resolved route-key (param values
 *      percent-encoded).
 *   2. On link click, STRICTLY scan both the live DOM and the incoming HTML
 *      into segment → {routeKey, range} maps. Any pairing violation poisons
 *      the scan.
 *   3. Two-tier DECISION (Next.js remount parity), nothing applied yet: a
 *      CHANGED route-key REPLACES (fresh remount) at the PARENT of the
 *      shallowest changed boundary (whose range contains the changed layout's
 *      own markup), else MORPH (keyed reconcile preserving input values,
 *      scroll, popover state, and node identity) at the deepest shared
 *      boundary.
 *   4. A poisoned scan or no shared boundary degrades to a FULL PAGE LOAD:
 *      bounded and correct, never a guessed recovery.
 *   5. Commit, in this order: `history.pushState`, then merge head, then apply
 *      the replace/morph from step 3, then re-run scripts and upgrade custom
 *      elements. Only the push moved (#1406); the rest of the sequence is
 *      unchanged. The push leads so the entry for the page being left is
 *      finalized while that page is still the live document, rather than
 *      against the content that replaced it. This is Turbo Drive's ordering
 *      too.
 *
 *      #1406 justified the move as the fix for the blank iOS back-swipe
 *      preview, on the theory that WebKit binds the gesture snapshot to page
 *      state at the moment the entry is recorded. That theory is FALSE, shown
 *      on-device in #1428: Turbo Drive has this exact ordering and previews
 *      blank the same way, and the real cause was
 *      `history.scrollRestoration = 'manual'` suppressing the browser's
 *      per-entry scroll recording. The ordering stands on its own merits;
 *      it just never fixed that bug.
 *
 * Optimizations bundled into the same response cycle:
 *   - `X-Webjs-Have` request header lists `segment:route-key` entries for
 *     the boundaries the client already has. The server walks the target's
 *     layout chain and short-circuits at the deepest FULL match (segment AND
 *     key, so a dynamic layout held for other params is re-rendered), then
 *     returns only the divergent fragment (wrapped in the matched boundary).
 *     Real wire-byte savings: the layout chain is never re-serialized for
 *     same-shell navigations.
 *   - URL-keyed snapshot cache (Turbo SnapshotCache pattern). Back/
 *     forward via popstate restores from cache instantly, then
 *     revalidates in the background.
 *   - Per-segment loading templates: SSR emits each segment's
 *     loading.ts content as `<template id="wj-loading:<path>">`. On
 *     nav-start the client clones the deepest matching template into
 *     the swap slot so users see an instant skeleton instead of stale
 *     content.
 *
 * Escape hatch:
 *   `<webjs-frame id="...">`: declarative partial-swap region NOT
 *   tied to a folder layout. If a link's enclosing `closest('webjs-frame')`
 *   matches a frame in the incoming HTML, the frame swap takes
 *   precedence over the layout-marker mechanism. Use for ad-hoc
 *   widgets (tabs, lazy-loaded cards) where the swap region isn't a
 *   folder route segment.
