/**
 * Absorb the popstate produced by a fragment click the router bowed out of.
 *
 * The spec's "navigate to a fragment" ends by firing popstate, so an ordinary
 * `<a href="#section">` click reaches `onPopState`, which treated every
 * popstate as back/forward and re-navigated. That re-fetched the page and
 * re-swapped the DOM, destroying live node identity and hydrated state outside
 * the anchor and undoing the jump the reader had just asked for (#1437).
 *
 * The gate is PROVENANCE, and it is the only thing that works. The router SAW
 * the click it bowed out of, and it never sees a traversal, so `onClick` leaves
 * a mark and the next popstate consumes it (`state.js` documents the lifetime).
 * Two earlier attempts tried to decide this from the urls instead and both were
 * measured wrong, because the urls carry no signal that separates the cases:
 *
 *   - a REPEAT click REPLACES its entry rather than pushing, so it arrives with
 *     `location.href` UNCHANGED, exactly like a Back between two distinct
 *     entries that share a url. (Two clicks of one `#sec` link give two
 *     popstates at the same href, `history.length` unchanged, measured in
 *     Chromium.) So an unchanged url cannot mean "absorb".
 *   - a CHANGED url cannot mean "absorb" either. Same pathname and search does
 *     prove the two entries resolve to the same server response, but not that
 *     they hold the same DOM, and a swap in between makes them differ. The
 *     no-JS write path reaches that shape: `getSubmitAction` prefers the raw
 *     `action` ATTRIBUTE (`form-encoder.js:33`), which carries no fragment, so
 *     a bound-submitter form declaring `action="/p"` pushes its 422 re-render
 *     at `/p` while the reader sits at `/p#sec`. Back from that validation
 *     error differs only by fragment and still has to re-render.
 *
 * So a popstate the router did not cause is left alone, whatever its url.
 *
 * What that does NOT cover, deliberately: an ordinary Back or Forward between
 * two fragment states of one page, which is a traversal with no click behind
 * it, so it still re-navigates as it does today. Telling that apart from the
 * 422 case needs to know whether the DOM was replaced between the two ENTRIES,
 * which is per-entry state the router does not keep (`history.pushState` is
 * called with `null` throughout). Turbo tags its entries for exactly this
 * reason. Adding that here is a larger change than this fix, and getting it
 * wrong reintroduces a swallowed Back, so this stops at the click.
 *
 * It RECORDS as well as deciding, so `currentPageUrl` tracks the fragment the
 * reader is on. That field is otherwise written only in the `finally` of a
 * completed navigation, and `snapshotCurrent` keys through `cacheKey`, which
 * strips the fragment, so the record cannot disturb the snapshot cache.
 *
 * @param {string} href  The destination, i.e. `location.href` at popstate time.
 * @returns {boolean} True when the popstate was absorbed and the caller must do

 * frame's link would repaint it with staler bytes than are already on screen.
 * The evict half runs only once the swap has COMMITTED, so a load that aborts,
 * fails, or hits `webjs:frame-missing` leaves the warm entry alone: the frame
 * still shows its old content, which that entry still matches.

/**
 * Submit a form via the partial-swap pipeline. Mirrors performNavigation

 *
 * Mutating methods (anything except GET/HEAD) clear the whole snapshot
 * cache after a successful response: Turbo's `clearSnapshotCache()` on
 * `!isSafe` (`navigator.js:71-88`). Other URLs in the cache may have
 * been server-side-mutated by this submission; refusing to clear would
 * serve stale content on subsequent back/forward.
 *
 * Submission-state events + aria-busy: while the enhanced submission fetch
 * is in flight the router sets `aria-busy="true"` on the FORM element and
 * dispatches `webjs:submit-start` (detail `{ form, url }`); on EVERY settle
 * path (success swap, validation re-render, navigation error, abort by a
 * superseding submit/nav) it clears `aria-busy` and dispatches
 * `webjs:submit-end` (detail `{ form, url, ok }`, `ok` = the submission was
 * not an error outcome). The toggle uses the same nav-token guard the
 * `<webjs-frame>` busy state uses (`formBusyTokens` / `markFormBusy` /
 * `clearFormBusy`): a superseded submit's teardown never clears the busy
 * state a NEWER submit already set, so a rapid re-submit stays busy until the
 * live submission settles. The native `aria-busy` attribute on the form is
 * the readable "is this form submitting" primitive (any component can read
 * it); the events are the push-notification counterpart. Progressive
 * enhancement: with JS off this whole code path is skipped and the form is a
 * plain POST.
 *
 * @param {string} href     Absolute target URL.
 * @param {string} method   Lowercased HTTP verb.
 * @param {FormData | URLSearchParams} body  Encoded per the declared enctype
 *   (#1307): `FormData` for multipart, `URLSearchParams` for urlencoded. Both
 *   iterate as `[name, value]` pairs, which is all the safe-method query-string
 *   promotion below needs, and `fetch` derives the right content type from
 *   either without an explicit header.
 * @param {string | null} frameId
 * @param {HTMLFormElement | null} [form]  The submitted form, for busy + events.
 * @param {{ preserveScroll?: boolean }} [opts]  `preserveScroll` keeps the
 *   reader's offset instead of scrolling to top after the response applies
 *   (#1436), from `data-preserve-scroll` on the form or its submitter. The case

/* ====================================================================
 * Link prefetch (Remix-style strategies, fast-by-default)
 *
 * A link click already resolves through fetchAndApply, but the fetch
 * only STARTS on click, so the user waits a full round-trip. Prefetch
 * warms a dedicated cache speculatively so the click reads it instantly.
 *
 * Strategy per anchor via a `data-prefetch` attribute (valid-HTML data-*,
 * like SvelteKit / Astro). The default is DEVICE-ADAPTIVE so the common case
 * is fast on every device without per-link opt-in: `intent` on a hover-capable
 * pointer (a real head-start before the click), `viewport` on touch (no hover
 * exists, and `touchstart` fires too close to the tap to front-run it). Value
 * vocabulary borrows Next's true/false/auto aliases:
 *   - absent (default)       : intent on pointer, viewport on touch (adaptive)
 *   - intent                 : hover / focus / touch, after a short dwell
 *   - true / render          : eager, as soon as a document scan sees it
 *   - auto / viewport        : on viewport entry (IntersectionObserver, 0.5),
 *                              after a dwell so a fast scroll-through skips it
 *   - false / none           : never (also data-no-prefetch / rel="external")
 *
 * Why a separate cache, not snapshotCache: snapshotCache is keyed to the
 * back/forward restore path (popstate), which holds the FULL serialized
 * document of pages the user already visited. A prefetch holds the
 * SERVER FRAGMENT for a page not yet visited (the same X-Webjs-Have
 * partial body a real nav would receive). fetchAndApply consumes it via
 * prefetchTake() before falling back to the network.
 *
 * Only same-origin in-app links are prefetched (the same eligibility as
 * a click), and never under Save-Data / prefers-reduced-data / a 2g link,
 * never past a small concurrency cap, and never twice (deduped + cached). The
 * viewport path additionally waits a dwell and cancels on scroll-out, so a
 * fast scroll through a long list does not flood the network tab. There is no
 * logout-style heuristic: prefetch issues a real GET, so as everywhere in
 * the ecosystem (Next / Nuxt / Remix), a non-idempotent action must be a
 * POST or a `<form>`, and `data-no-prefetch` / `rel="external"` opt out.
 *
 * What we do NOT touch: a native `<link rel="prefetch">` in the document
 * head is the browser's own mechanism and warms the HTTP cache; we never
 * interfere with it.
