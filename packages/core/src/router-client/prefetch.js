 *
 * The default is adaptive (not a single `intent`) because `intent` does not
 * help on mobile: a touch device has no hover, and `touchstart` fires at tap
 * time, so the prefetch races the navigation. On touch we default to
 * `viewport` (warm links as they settle on-screen) and keep `touchstart` as an
 * extra warm for the tapped link; on a pointer device `intent` stays the
