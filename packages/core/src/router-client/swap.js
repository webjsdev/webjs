 * @returns {'discard' | 'none' | undefined} `'discard'` when a background
 *   revalidation was thrown away, `'none'` when it returned without committing
 *   anything (a missing frame, or a degradation to a hard navigation), and
 *   `undefined` when a swap committed. `fetchAndApply` maps the first two to
 *   `applied: false`.
 * @param {'page' | 'shell' | 'layouts' | undefined} [refresh]  The swap tier
 *   override. `'shell'` and `'page'` are the same-URL in-place refresh modes
 *   (#1398). `'shell'` takes the full-body tier directly, because the
 *   layout's OWN markup changed and that lives outside every children range.
 *   `'page'` falls through to the normal two-tier logic, which morphs the
 *   deepest shared boundary and so preserves outer-layout component state.
 *   `'layouts'` is the response to a mutating form submission (#1557): the
 *   normal two-tier logic, followed by a morph of the layout chrome outside
 *   the plan's range (`morphLayoutChrome`), or the full-body tier when that
 *   chrome cannot be walked safely.
 * @param {(() => void) | null} [recordHistoryNow]  Record this navigation's
 *   history entry (#1406). Called at each COMMIT point, immediately BEFORE the
 *   DOM mutation, for the same reason `ingestSeeds` is: this function can still
 *   decide to throw the response away after parsing it, and a `pushState`
 *   issued for a swap that never happened is worse than a late one. It runs
 *   BEFORE the incoming document replaces what is on screen, so the entry for
 *   the page being left is finalized while that page is still the live
 *   document (#1406, and Turbo Drive's ordering).
 *
 *   NOTE: #1406 believed this ordering fixed the blank iOS back-swipe
 *   preview. It does not, shown on-device in #1428; the cause was
 *   `history.scrollRestoration = 'manual'`.
 *
 *   "Before the content swap" is the precise claim, NOT "before anything on
 *   the page has changed". The page may already have been mutated by the time
 *   this runs, and on one route class it reliably has: where the live chain
 *   contains a boundary carrying a `loading.{js,ts}` template,
 *   `applyOptimisticLoading` swapped that range for the skeleton and let the
 *   engine clamp the offset before the fetch was even issued. (It is the
 *   innermost boundary WITH a template, found by walking deepest-first and
 *   skipping any without one, so usually not the deepest boundary: that is
 *   normally the page's own, and a `loading` file sits next to a layout.) The
 *   snapshot there is of this route's shell plus a skeleton, which still beats
 *   the destination document, but it is not the page the reader left. Fixing
 *   that class means recording the entry ahead of the optimistic swap too,
 *   which is a separate change on a path nothing here measured.
 *
 *   The caller's thunk is one-shot, so it is safe to call here AND on the
 *   caller's fall-through. Omitted or null on every path that records no
 *   history (a revalidation, a refresh, the popstate restore).
