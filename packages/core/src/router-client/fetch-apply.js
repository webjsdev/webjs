 * @param {string} href
 * @param {string | null} frameId
 * @param {boolean} recordHistory
 * @param {{ slot: { start: Comment, end: Comment }, oldChildren: Node[], token: number } | null} optimisticState
 * @param {string} [method]  HTTP verb (uppercase). Default 'GET'.
 * @param {BodyInit | null} [body]  Request body for non-GET methods.
 * @param {AbortSignal | null} [signal]  Abort signal. A newer nav cancels this fetch.
 * @param {number} [token]  Nav-token captured at the caller's entry; stale → skip apply.
 * @param {boolean} [revalidating]  True for the BACKGROUND refresh after a
 *   snapshot restore: the user is already viewing a page, so a boundary
 *   mismatch must degrade in place (never a jarring `location.href` load).
 * @param {{ refresh?: 'page' | 'shell', noPrefetch?: boolean, preserveScroll?: boolean }} [opts]
 *   Per-navigation POLICY, as a bag rather than three more positionals. The
 *   nine parameters above are request inputs; these three decide what the
 *   pipeline does with the response, and the list was already at eleven.
 *
 *   `refresh` is a same-URL in-place refresh (#1398). It suppresses the
 *   `X-Webjs-Have` header and picks the swap tier; see `refreshPage`.
 *
 *   `noPrefetch` never consumes a speculative entry, whatever the cache holds
 *   (#1407). Set by `loadFrame`: a `<webjs-frame src>` self-load or `src`
 *   mutation asks for THIS frame's content now, which is a freshness request
 *   rather than the click-follows-hover shape the warm cache serves.
 *
 *   `preserveScroll` keeps the reader's current offset instead of scrolling to
 *   top on a forward navigation (#1436), from `data-preserve-scroll` on the
 *   link or form, or from `navigate(url, { scroll: false })`. It suppresses only
 *   the scroll-to-top writes, never the hash-anchor scroll.
 * @returns {Promise<{ ok: boolean, status: number | null, aborted: boolean, applied: boolean }>}
 *   The fetch outcome, so a caller (the form-submission busy/event lifecycle)
 *   can report whether the submission settled as a success, an error, or an
 *   abort. `ok` mirrors `response.ok` for an HTTP response (a 422 validation
 *   re-render is `ok:false`), `false` for a transport/parse error, and `false`
 *   for an abort (which also sets `aborted:true`). `status` is the HTTP status
 *   or `null` when the request never produced one.
 *
 *   `applied` is a DIFFERENT question from `ok` and the two must not be
 *   conflated (#1398). An HTML body of ANY status is parsed and swapped in
 *   place, which is the whole point of the 422-revalidation and error-boundary
 *   behaviour, so a page rendered through `notFound()`, `forbidden()`, or an
 *   `error.ts` boundary has `ok:false` and `applied:true`. It is `false`
 *   wherever no swap committed: a transport failure, a non-HTML body, an
 *   unparseable one, a 204/205, a discarded revalidation, an abort, and every
 *   `applySwap` path that returns without committing (a missing frame, or a
 *   degradation to a hard navigation from an importmap mismatch or a poisoned
 *   boundary scan). A caller deciding whether to fall back to a full page load
 *   wants `applied`; one reporting the submission's success wants `ok`.

  // ONE region and leaves the rest of the document standing, the scroll offset

  // in off screen. Turbo, which `<webjs-frame>` is modelled on, likewise never
  // scrolls on a frame navigation (its `autoscroll` opt-in is a separate
  // feature WebJs does not have). This is the same rule `restoreGeneration` in
