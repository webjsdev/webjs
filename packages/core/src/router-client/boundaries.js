/**
 * Walk a node tree collecting KEYED children-boundary pairs into a Map
 * keyed by segment path.
 *
 * Boundaries are HTML comments emitted by SSR around each layout's
 * children interpolation AND around the page itself:
 *   <!--wj:children:/docs:/docs-->            (open: segment + route-key)
 *     <page content>
 *   <!--/wj:children:/docs-->                 (close: segment)
 *
 * The close carries the SEGMENT, so pairing is deterministic id-matching:
 * a close must match the segment of the INNERMOST open boundary (proper
 * nesting), never a positional LIFO guess. The open additionally carries
 * the resolved ROUTE-KEY (param values percent-encoded at emit), which
 * `planBoundarySwap` compares between the live and incoming DOM to pick
 * the swap tier.
 *
 * STRICT INTEGRITY, by design (#1015): this scanner never guesses. ANY
 * violation poisons the whole scan and returns null:
 *   - an open with no route-key (the legacy anonymous format, or truncation)
 *   - a close whose segment does not match the innermost open boundary
 *   - a close with no open boundary at all
 *   - a duplicate segment (two boundaries claiming one id)
 *   - an open boundary never closed (truncated response)
 * The caller degrades a poisoned side to a FULL PAGE LOAD: bounded, correct,
 * and honest, where the deleted heuristic recovery (#994's orphan recovery +
 * trailing-count bounding) could guess wrong and corrupt silently. The main
 * PRODUCER of mispairing (our own comment-stripping parse, #1007, and
 * mid-parse soft navs, #1008) is already fixed upstream, so poisoning is a
 * rare backstop, not a common path.
 *
 * @param {ParentNode} root
 * @returns {Map<string, { routeKey: string, start: Comment, end: Comment }> | null}
 *   The boundary map, or null when the tree's boundaries are malformed.

/**
 * Plan the two-tier boundary swap from the live + incoming boundary maps
 * (#1015). Boundary segments are nested path prefixes, so the shared segments
 * form a chain from `/` down to the deepest shared boundary D.
 *
 * Rules (Next.js remount-vs-preserve parity):
 *  - A changed route-key REPLACES at the PARENT of the shallowest changed
 *    boundary. The parent, not the changed boundary itself: a LAYOUT's
 *    boundary wraps its CHILDREN slot, so the layout's OWN markup (an
 *    `[org]`-name header it renders around `${children}`) lives inside the
 *    PARENT's range. Anchoring at the parent remounts the changed layout's
 *    chrome AND its subtree, exactly like Next re-rendering the layout with
 *    new params. The page boundary composes the same way: its parent is the
 *    nearest layout's children slot, so `/blog/a` -> `/blog/b` under a
 *    `/blog` layout remounts just the page while the `/blog` layout chrome
 *    is preserved; with no intermediate layout the anchor is `/` and the
 *    root layout's chrome (outside its own children boundary) is still
 *    preserved. A changed boundary with NO shared parent degrades (null).
 *  - No route-key changed but the subtree below D diverges (D is a LAYOUT,
 *    not the deepest boundary, on either side, e.g. `/about` -> `/contact`
 *    under a shared static root layout): REPLACE D's contents wholesale.
 *  - No route-key changed and D is the deepest boundary on BOTH sides: MORPH
 *    D. The searchParams-only / refresh / revalidate nav, which must preserve
 *    hydrated component state while updating searchParam-driven DOM.
 *  - No shared segment at all: null (the caller degrades to a full load). In
 *    practice the page boundary exists on both sides of any same-app nav, so
 *    this is reached only for a divergent or malformed shell.
