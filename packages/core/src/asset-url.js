/**
 * Resolve a `public/` asset url (served at the url ROOT: `public/app.css` is
 * `/app.css`, as in Next.js) to its content-fingerprinted form, so a
 * deploy that changes the file changes the url and no cache can serve the
 * previous bytes.
 *
 *   import { html, asset } from '@webjsdev/core';
 *   html`<link rel="stylesheet" href=${asset('/app.css')}>`
 *
 * On the server, `@webjsdev/server` installs a provider that appends
 * `?v=<content-hash>`; the framework then serves a `?v=`-carrying request
 * `immutable` for a year instead of the short fallback. On the browser there
 * is no provider and the path is returned UNCHANGED.
 *
 * USE IT IN A PAGE, LAYOUT, OR METADATA ROUTE, not inside a component that
 * ships to the browser. Those modules render only on the server, so the
 * fingerprinted url is the one the browser sees and keeps. A component is
 * different: hydration is a full client RE-RENDER (`render-client.js` drops
 * the hydrate marker and `createInstance` replaces the SSR'd children), so
 * the client value overwrites the server one. With no provider in the
 * browser, `asset()` returns the bare path there, so an `<img src=${asset(
 * '/logo.svg')}>` inside a shipping component paints the hashed url
 * at SSR and then swaps it for the un-hashed one on upgrade, fetching the
 * same bytes twice and leaving the short-lived url in the DOM. It still
 * WORKS (the path is always valid), which is why this is a convention rather
 * than a `webjs check` rule, but it silently forfeits the caching the call
 * was for. Import the asset url into a layout, or accept the plain path.
 *
 * The sibling `cspNonce()` carries the same server/browser asymmetry and the
 * same scoping, for the same hydration reason.
 *
 * Calling it at module scope works too: the server installs its resolver at
 * boot, before any app module loads, so a hoisted `const CSS =
 * asset('/app.css')` in a page or layout resolves the same as one in render.
 *
 * Under `webjs.basePath`, write the prefix yourself: `asset('/app/x.css')`.
 * The framework only base-path-prefixes urls IT emits, so an author-written
 * url is already your responsibility (an un-prefixed one 404s under a
 * sub-path deploy with or without this helper). `asset()` strips the prefix
 * to find the file and keeps it on the url it returns.
 *
 * Mark files that change only with a DEPLOY. The hash is memoized for the
 * process lifetime, and prod never rebuilds, so a `public/` file rewritten in
 * place while the server runs keeps its old url while being served `immutable`
 * for a year. A build artifact (a compiled stylesheet, a bundled script, a
 * committed image) is exactly right; a runtime-written upload is not, and
 * should keep its plain path (or carry its own version in the filename).
 *
 * Why this is opt-in rather than automatic. An earlier attempt (#1196)
 * rewrote asset urls by matching the assembled HTML, and two deep-review
 * rounds found six major defects, five of them the same bug: at that layer
 * framework output and author data are indistinguishable, so the matcher kept
 * touching things it did not own (a custom element's reactive prop, a
 * rendered code sample, a `rel=preload` hint whose real request comes from
 * CSS, a data-driven `src` pointing at `/.env`). Marking the url at the point
 * the author writes it makes the meaning unambiguous, so the blast radius is
 * exactly the set of urls someone deliberately marked and nothing else in the
 * document is ever read or rewritten.
 *
 * Scope note: only a file that exists under `public/` is fingerprinted,
 * matching what the static-asset route will actually serve. Anything else is
 * returned unchanged rather than guessed at.
