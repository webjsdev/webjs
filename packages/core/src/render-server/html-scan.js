/**
 * Byte ranges of `html` where a tag-shaped match is NOT an element (#1128).
 *
 * The element scanners below match tags with a flat regex over already-
 * assembled markup, which has no notion of an HTML context. So a registered tag
 * name written inside a comment used to be constructed and rendered as a real
 * element, and the replacement consumed the rest of the comment INCLUDING its
 * closing `-->`, leaving an unterminated comment that swallowed every following
 * byte. Whether it happened depended on whether the name in the comment was a
 * registered component, which is what made it look random.
 *
 * This is a single left-to-right pass rather than a search for `<!--`, because
 * the naive version introduces failures worse than the bug: an `<!--` inside an
 * attribute value (`title="use <!-- here"`) or inside RCDATA would open a region
 * that never closes, and every component after it would silently stop rendering.
 * Deciding that requires knowing the context, which means tokenizing, so the
 * pass tracks the same states the HTML parser does for these purposes:
 *
 * - **Comments**, including the spec's short forms. `<!-->` and `<!--->` close
 *   immediately, `--!>` closes as well as `-->`, and an unterminated comment
 *   runs to EOF, exactly as a browser would treat the same bytes.
 * - **Markup declarations and bogus comments** (`<!doctype …>`, `<![CDATA[…]]>`),
 *   which end at the next `>`.
 * - **Tags**, consumed with their quoted attribute values, so `<` and `<!--`
 *   inside an attribute are inert rather than context-changing.
 * - **Text-only elements**, whose content the HTML tokenizer never reads as
 *   markup: raw text (`script`, `style`, `iframe`, `xmp`, `noembed`,
 *   `noframes`, `plaintext`) and RCDATA (`textarea`, `title`). Their content is
 *   returned as a skip range too, because a component tag inside a `<style>`
 *   comment or an `<iframe>` fallback hit the identical markup-destroying path,
 *   so excluding them would leave half the bug live.
 *
 *   Two deliberate exclusions. `<template>` content IS parsed and legitimately
 *   carries components (Declarative Shadow DOM and the streamed swap templates
 *   both depend on that). `<noscript>` content is parsed as markup when
 *   scripting is disabled, which for a progressive-enhancement framework is the
 *   case that matters, so components inside it must keep rendering.
