/**
 * THE attribute reader, singular.
 *
 * `attributeChangedCallback` in `component.js` and `applyAttrsToInstance` in
 * `render-server.js` are both thin callers of the two functions below, so the
 * client and the SSR pass cannot drift on precedence, on a fallback, or on
 * which attributes they read at all. They had drifted four ways before this
 * module existed: the unparseable-JSON fallback (#1253), a missing converter
 * arm (#1340), and three name-resolution gaps plus the entity decoding (#1341).
 *
 * The split between the two exports is the one place the sides legitimately
 * differ. `resolveAttributeProperty` takes the name the PLATFORM would deliver,
 * so the SSR caller lowercases its source name first and the client passes the
 * browser's name straight through. Everything after that is common.
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN MODULE, rather than living beside the declaration semantics it
 * interprets in `component.js`. That was the first shape, and `component.d.ts`
 * cannot carry the declaration for it: `index.d.ts` re-exports that overlay
 * with a bare `export *`, so a value declared there joins the ROOT public type
 * surface of `@webjsdev/core` while `index.js` exports no such runtime value.
 * An app writing `import { readAttributeValue } from '@webjsdev/core'` would
 * then type-check and crash at load, which is exactly the phantom the #1031
 * guard in `test/types/dts-no-phantom-exports.test.mjs` exists to catch, and it
 * caught this one. Re-exporting the function from `index.js` would silence the
 * guard by making an internal framework seam app-facing API, which is the wrong
 * trade. A module with no `.d.ts` overlay keeps the seam internal and typed
 * from its own JSDoc, which is how `escape.js` and `binding-prefixes.js`
 * already work.
 *
 * It also drops an edge rather than adding one: `render-server.js` reaches the
 * reader without importing `component.js` at all.
 *
 * lit solves the same problem structurally, though in the other direction.
 * `@lit-labs/ssr`'s LitElementRenderer forwards its `attributeChangedCallback`
 * into the element's own `_$attributeToProperty` through
 * `lit-element/private-ssr-support.js`, so its server pass runs the browser's
 * reader rather than a copy of it. lit can reach INTO the element because its
 * elements are TypeScript with a generated declaration; WebJs ships buildless
 * JS under a hand-written overlay, so the shared code moves out instead.

 * than only the ones that parse. This used to be a third `decode` parameter

 * Resolve an attribute NAME to the property it feeds, and to that property's
 * normalised declaration.
 *
 * `state: true` props are skipped, because they are absent from
 * `observedAttributes` and so the browser never delivers their attribute to any
 * reader. lit reaches the same outcome the same way, resolving through the very
 * map `observedAttributes` is built from (`reactive-element.ts`
 * `_$attributeToProperty`).
 *
 * `attrName` must already be the name the PLATFORM would deliver. The browser
 * lowercases attribute names while parsing, so the SSR caller lowercases its
 * source name before calling and the client caller passes the browser's name
 * through untouched. That one step is the only thing that differs between the
 * two sides, which is why it lives in the callers and not here. A custom
 * `attribute` option is matched VERBATIM, as lit matches it and as a browser
 * would, so a camelCase custom attribute stays unreachable from markup rather
 * than being reachable at SSR only. Lowercasing the DECLARED side would make
 * SSR read MORE than a browser can deliver, which is the bug this function
 * exists to remove, so do not add it.
 *
 * The match is EXACTLY the names `observedAttributeNames` lists (the
 * `d.attribute || hyphenate(k)` primary plus, for a camelCase prop with no
 * custom attribute, its lowercased alias, #1540), and nothing else. A `props[attrName] ||
 * props[camelCase(attrName)]` fallback used to sit after the loop, so a prop
 * declaring a custom attribute also answered to its PROPERTY name. Both readers
 * carried that code, which read like an agreement and was not one: the browser
 * only ever calls in with a name from `observedAttributes`, and that list holds
 * the declared attribute alone, so the fallback was unreachable on the client
 * and live on the server. Measured, `open: prop(Boolean, { attribute:
 * 'is-open' })` with `<my-el open>` SSR'd `true` and upgraded to the
 * constructor value. Deriving the match from the same expression the observed
 * list is built from is what makes the two sides agree by construction rather
 * than by two copies staying in step (#1341).
