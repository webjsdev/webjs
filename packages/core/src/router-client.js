/**
 * Client router for webjs: nested-layout-aware partial swap.
 *
 * Intercepts same-origin link clicks and form submissions, fetches the
 * target page's HTML via `fetch()`, finds the deepest layout boundary
 * shared by both the current and incoming pages, and replaces ONLY the
 * children of that boundary. Outer layout DOM (header, sidenav, footer)
 * stays mounted: no re-render, no flicker, scroll positions preserved.
 *
 * Enablement is automatic: this module calls `enableClientRouter()` at its
 * end (idempotent), and the `@webjsdev/core` browser entry loads it, so any
 * page that ships a component gets the router with no import to add. Call
 * `disableClientRouter()` to opt out, or `enableClientRouter()` for
 * programmatic control.
 *
 * Mechanism: auto-derived from folder structure (#1015):
 *   1. SSR injects KEYED boundary comment pairs around each layout's
 *      `${children}` interpolation and around the page itself:
 *      `<!--wj:children:<segment>:<route-key>-->` ... `<!--/wj:children:<segment>-->`.
 *      The close carries the segment (deterministic id-matched pairing, no
 *      LIFO), the open carries the resolved route-key (param values
 *      percent-encoded).
 *   2. On link click, STRICTLY scan both the live DOM and the incoming HTML
 *      into segment → {routeKey, range} maps. Any pairing violation poisons
 *      the scan.
 *   3. Two-tier decision (Next.js remount parity): a CHANGED route-key
 *      REPLACES (fresh remount) at the PARENT of the shallowest changed
 *      boundary (whose range contains the changed layout's own markup),
 *      else MORPH (keyed reconcile preserving input values, scroll, popover
 *      state, and node identity) at the deepest shared boundary.
 *   4. A poisoned scan or no shared boundary degrades to a FULL PAGE LOAD:
 *      bounded and correct, never a guessed recovery.
 *   5. Merge head, re-run scripts, upgrade custom elements, pushState.
 *
 * Optimizations bundled into the same response cycle:
 *   - `X-Webjs-Have` request header lists `segment:route-key` entries for
 *     the boundaries the client already has. The server walks the target's
 *     layout chain and short-circuits at the deepest FULL match (segment AND
 *     key, so a dynamic layout held for other params is re-rendered), then
 *     returns only the divergent fragment (wrapped in the matched boundary).
 *     Real wire-byte savings: the layout chain is never re-serialized for
 *     same-shell navigations.
 *   - URL-keyed snapshot cache (Turbo SnapshotCache pattern). Back/
 *     forward via popstate restores from cache instantly, then
 *     revalidates in the background.
 *   - Per-segment loading templates: SSR emits each segment's
 *     loading.ts content as `<template id="wj-loading:<path>">`. On
 *     nav-start the client clones the deepest matching template into
 *     the swap slot so users see an instant skeleton instead of stale
 *     content.
 *
 * Escape hatch:
 *   `<webjs-frame id="...">`: declarative partial-swap region NOT
 *   tied to a folder layout. If a link's enclosing `closest('webjs-frame')`
 *   matches a frame in the incoming HTML, the frame swap takes
 *   precedence over the layout-marker mechanism. Use for ad-hoc
 *   widgets (tabs, lazy-loaded cards) where the swap region isn't a
 *   folder route segment.

/**
 * Parse a navigation response into a Document, PRESERVING COMMENTS.
 *
 * Comments are load-bearing here, not incidental: the partial swap pairs on
 * `<!--wj:children:<path>-->` markers and hydration keys off `<!--webjs-hydrate-->`.
 * `Document.parseHTMLUnsafe` would be the natural choice (it is the only
 * single-pass API that also processes Declarative Shadow DOM) but it STRIPS
 * EVERY COMMENT in Chromium 150 (#1007), which deletes both. So it is used only
 * when a one-time probe proves it lossless on this engine, and otherwise we parse
 * with DOMParser (comments preserved; DSD is left unprocessed, see
 * `parseDocumentPreservingComments` for why that gap beats both ways of closing it).
 *
 * A partial-nav response (#936) is an INNER fragment that BEGINS with the
 * `<!--wj:children:<segment>:<route-key>-->` boundary open and carries no
 * `<!doctype>`/`<html>`. Parsing such a fragment as a DOCUMENT hoists that
 * leading comment OUT of `<body>` (the HTML parser's "before html" insertion
 * mode makes a leading comment a child of the document, before `<html>`), so
 * `collectBoundaries(doc.body)` never sees the opening boundary, finds no
 * shared segment, and `applySwap` degrades to a full load. So a fragment is
 * parsed in BODY (fragment) context instead, keeping the boundary with its
 * content.
 * `body.setHTMLUnsafe` also processes Declarative Shadow DOM, so a shadow
 * component inside the swapped content still re-attaches its root; the
 * `<template>` path is the fallback for browsers without it (markers preserved,
 * DSD not, which matches the pre-`setHTMLUnsafe` baseline).

 * gap (measured on Chromium 150, not reasoned about):
 *
 *   - `body.setHTMLUnsafe(body.innerHTML)` re-serializes, and that round-trip is
 *     not idempotent: Chromium omits the spec's LF-compensation rule (append
 *     U+000A when a `pre` / `textarea` / `listing` element's first Text child
 *     starts with one), so `<textarea>\n\nfoo</textarea>` parses to `"\nfoo"`
 *     natively but `"foo"` after a round-trip. In a `<textarea>` that is silent
 *     form-data corruption: a soft nav would submit different bytes than a hard
 *     refresh.
 *   - Attaching each root by hand (`host.attachShadow()` + move the template's
 *     nodes) is USELESS on the common path and HARMFUL on the other. Useless
 *     because the marker swap imports with `document.importNode(n, true)`, which
 *     drops a shadow root unless it is `clonable`, and SSR emits a bare
 *     `<template shadowrootmode="open">`, so the root never survives the import
 *     and `component.js` re-attaches from scratch exactly as it always did.
 *     Harmful because the full-body-swap path ADOPTS instead, so a script-created
 *     root does survive, and a script-created root is not `declarative`: the spec
 *     only permits a second `attachShadow()` over an existing root when that root
 *     is declarative, so any element whose constructor unconditionally calls
 *     `attachShadow()` then throws `NotSupportedError` on upgrade, where the
 *     native parse it replaced worked fine.
 *
 * The gap this leaves is narrow and strictly better than the bug it replaces: on
 * a comment-stripping browser only, an element that depends on DSD content and
 * ships NO JavaScript loses that content on a full-body-swap navigation. Every
 * WebJs `static shadow = true` component is unaffected, because it attaches and

 * markup have not upgraded and re-rendered yet. When they do, content grows
 * ABOVE the viewport, and scroll anchoring (`overflow-anchor: auto`, the UA
 * default) holds the VISUAL position by adding that growth to `scrollY`. The
 * offset is counted twice. On webjs.dev's `/ui/button` that lands the reader
 * 763px too low, exactly the settled-minus-swapped height delta.
 *
 * Anchoring is right for a reader on a live page and wrong for exactly this
 * window, where the restored number already accounts for the growth. So the
 * window suppresses it rather than re-scrolling afterwards. A re-assert would
 * have to fire on every growth, and a settling restore cannot be told apart
 * from a `<webjs-suspense>` boundary streaming in (#471 / #473). Suppression
 * never MOVES the viewport, it only withholds a correction, so it also cannot
 * yank a reader who has already started scrolling.
 *
 * Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit all implement scroll anchoring, and all three
 * honour `overflow-anchor: none` identically whether it sits on the root
 * scroller or on `<body>`, so there is no engine-specific path here.
 *
 * It goes on the ROOT, and `<body>` is not an alternative even though it looks
 * like the tidier one. Suppressing on `<body>` works identically on all three
 * engines (the property excludes an element and its subtree from being chosen
 * as the anchor, and every candidate lives under `<body>`), and it would avoid
 * writing to the root at all, which is worth wanting: toggling something on the
 * root re-runs global style resolution, and on WebKit that re-resolves
 * `oklch()` token values and repaints them for a frame, which is the #610 flash
 * that made `data-navigating` opt-in.
 *
 * It is disqualified by the RELEASE, not the suppression. On WebKit, anchoring
 * never resumes once it has been suppressed on `<body>`: removing the property,
 * setting it back to `auto`, and both in sequence were each measured, and after
 * every one the next growth above the viewport still failed to move `scrollY`.
 * Suppressing on the root resumes correctly on all three. Since the whole point
 * is that suppression is TEMPORARY, a placement that cannot be undone would

 * knows exactly where it is going and can tell when it has arrived: it runs
 * ONLY on the clamped path, only while the offset is still out of reach, writes
 * once, and stops on the first real input.
 *
 * It does NOT escape the settling-versus-streaming question, and it is worth

 * lives for `ANCHOR_SUPPRESS_FLOOR_MS` from the RESTORE and no longer. That is

 * because this path WRITES scroll. The suppression this path installs once the
 * chase lands is part of the same window, not a second one: it shares this
 * deadline, so the whole clamped path is bounded by one floor measured from the
 * restore however late the landing happens.
 *
 * Be precise about what the bound does and does not buy, since it is easy to
 * overclaim in both directions. WHILE the window is open the reader is
 * protected: until the offset is reachable there is nothing to protect, and
 * from the moment the chase lands on it, suppression holds it against the rest
 * of the growth. AFTER the window closes, both halves stop: the router writes
 * no more scroll, and anchoring is back on, so any growth still arriving is
 * added to `scrollY` and carries the reader down toward the bottom, which is

 *
 * Rules (Next.js remount-vs-preserve parity):
 *  - A changed route-key REPLACES at the PARENT of the shallowest changed
 *    boundary. The parent, not the changed boundary itself: a LAYOUT's
 *    boundary wraps its CHILDREN slot, so the layout's OWN markup (an
 *    `[org]`-name header it renders around `${children}`) lives inside the
 *    PARENT's range. Anchoring at the parent remounts the changed layout's
 *    chrome AND its subtree, exactly like Next re-rendering the layout with
 *    new params. The page boundary composes the same way: its parent is the
 *    nearest layout's children slot, so `/blog/a` -> `/blog/b` under a
 *    `/blog` layout remounts just the page while the `/blog` layout chrome
 *    is preserved; with no intermediate layout the anchor is `/` and the
 *    root layout's chrome (outside its own children boundary) is still
 *    preserved. A changed boundary with NO shared parent degrades (null).
 *  - No route-key changed but the subtree below D diverges (D is a LAYOUT,
 *    not the deepest boundary, on either side, e.g. `/about` -> `/contact`
 *    under a shared static root layout): REPLACE D's contents wholesale.
 *  - No route-key changed and D is the deepest boundary on BOTH sides: MORPH
 *    D. The searchParams-only / refresh / revalidate nav, which must preserve
 *    hydrated component state while updating searchParam-driven DOM.
 *  - No shared segment at all: null (the caller degrades to a full load). In

 *
 * Submission-state events + aria-busy: while the enhanced submission fetch

 * dispatches `webjs:submit-start` (detail `{ form, url }`); on EVERY settle
 * path (success swap, validation re-render, navigation error, abort by a
 * superseding submit/nav) it clears `aria-busy` and dispatches
 * `webjs:submit-end` (detail `{ form, url, ok }`, `ok` = the submission was
 * not an error outcome). The toggle uses the same nav-token guard the
 * `<webjs-frame>` busy state uses (`formBusyTokens` / `markFormBusy` /
 * `clearFormBusy`): a superseded submit's teardown never clears the busy
 * state a NEWER submit already set, so a rapid re-submit stays busy until the
 * live submission settles. The native `aria-busy` attribute on the form is
 * the readable "is this form submitting" primitive (any component can read

/* ====================================================================
 * Link prefetch (Remix-style strategies, fast-by-default)
 *
 * A link click already resolves through fetchAndApply, but the fetch
 * only STARTS on click, so the user waits a full round-trip. Prefetch
 * warms a dedicated cache speculatively so the click reads it instantly.
 *
 * Strategy per anchor via a `data-prefetch` attribute (valid-HTML data-*,
 * like SvelteKit / Astro). The default is DEVICE-ADAPTIVE so the common case
 * is fast on every device without per-link opt-in: `intent` on a hover-capable
 * pointer (a real head-start before the click), `viewport` on touch (no hover
 * exists, and `touchstart` fires too close to the tap to front-run it). Value
 * vocabulary borrows Next's true/false/auto aliases:
 *   - absent (default)       : intent on pointer, viewport on touch (adaptive)
 *   - intent                 : hover / focus / touch, after a short dwell
 *   - true / render          : eager, as soon as a document scan sees it
 *   - auto / viewport        : on viewport entry (IntersectionObserver, 0.5),
 *                              after a dwell so a fast scroll-through skips it
 *   - false / none           : never (also data-no-prefetch / rel="external")
 *
 * Why a separate cache, not snapshotCache: snapshotCache is keyed to the
 * back/forward restore path (popstate), which holds the FULL serialized
 * document of pages the user already visited. A prefetch holds the
 * SERVER FRAGMENT for a page not yet visited (the same X-Webjs-Have
 * partial body a real nav would receive). fetchAndApply consumes it via
 * prefetchTake() before falling back to the network.
 *
 * Only same-origin in-app links are prefetched (the same eligibility as
 * a click), and never under Save-Data / prefers-reduced-data / a 2g link,
 * never past a small concurrency cap, and never twice (deduped + cached). The
 * viewport path additionally waits a dwell and cancels on scroll-out, so a
 * fast scroll through a long list does not flood the network tab. There is no
 * logout-style heuristic: prefetch issues a real GET, so as everywhere in
 * the ecosystem (Next / Nuxt / Remix), a non-idempotent action must be a
 * POST or a `<form>`, and `data-no-prefetch` / `rel="external"` opt out.
 *
 * What we do NOT touch: a native `<link rel="prefetch">` in the document
 * head is the browser's own mechanism and warms the HTTP cache; we never
 * interfere with it.

 *   - absent / unknown   : the DEVICE-ADAPTIVE default (intent on a pointer,
 *                          viewport on touch); an explicit value always wins

 *   - `auto` / `viewport`: on viewport entry (IntersectionObserver), after a dwell
 *   - `false` / `none`   : never (also via data-no-prefetch / rel="external")
 *
 * The default is adaptive (not a single `intent`) because `intent` does not
 * help on mobile: a touch device has no hover, and `touchstart` fires at tap
 * time, so the prefetch races the navigation. On touch we default to
 * `viewport` (warm links as they settle on-screen) and keep `touchstart` as an
 * extra warm for the tapped link; on a pointer device `intent` stays the
 * default (precise, cheap, a real head-start before the click). A per-link
 * `data-prefetch` always overrides the adaptive default.

/**
 * Re-execute every `<script>` in `container`, INCLUDING `container` itself when
 * it is one (#1102). A script parsed by `DOMParser` carries the spec's
 * "already started" flag, so the node grafted into the live document is inert
 * and only a fresh clone runs. `querySelectorAll` never matches the element it
 * is called on, so a container-is-a-script was silently skipped: the two swap
 * tiers hand this function each TOP-LEVEL node of the swapped range in turn, so
 * a script emitted as a sibling of the content (a layout's progressive-
 * enhancement script, the shape that surfaced this) never ran after a soft nav.
 *
 * Replacing the container DETACHES it, which is why both callers snapshot the
 * range before iterating rather than walking live `nextSibling` links.
 *
 * `data-webjs-permanent` splits into two cases here, and the split is the whole
 * rule (#1252):
 *
 *   - The marked element IS a script: NEVER exempt, however the walk reaches
 *     it. This holds whether it arrives as the `container` or as a descendant
 *     of one, because the regraft selector has no tag filter and will happily
 *     preserve a `<script id data-webjs-permanent>` by identity. The exemption
 *     below is therefore STRICT containment, never reflexive. This must not be
 *     changed. The regrafts have a both-exist guard, so on the swap that first
 *     mounts a route there is no live node to preserve, the inert parsed copy
 *     is what lands, and exempting it would leave a script that runs on a cold
 *     load and never on a soft navigation. That is precisely the #1102 failure,
 *     reintroduced under the banner of fixing it. A script's only state is that
 *     it ran, and re-running is the contract for everything in a swapped range.
 *   - A script INSIDE a marked element that was ACTUALLY preserved: exempt.
 *     The attribute means the subtree survives as the same live node, which is
 *     what `diffElementInPlace` already implements by returning early rather
 *     than recursing into it. Re-emitting an init script against a widget
 *     instance the author deliberately kept alive is a double-initialization,
 *     not a refresh.
 *
 * The filter keys on `regraftedPermanents` (actual preservation by identity),
 * never on the attribute alone. A permanent element arriving for the FIRST time
 * was never preserved, so its scripts have never run and must run now; an
 * attribute-only filter would leave them never running on any path.
 *
 * @param {Element} container
 * @returns {Element} `container`, or its replacement when it was a script that
 *   was re-emitted. The replacement sits wherever `container` was; when
 *   `container` was already detached, `replaceWith` is a spec no-op and the
 *   returned clone is detached too, so callers must not assume it is connected.

 * skipping every node after it (#1102).
 *
 * The snapshot is taken AFTER the tier has finished writing the range (the
 * replace tier's insert loop, the morph tier's `reconcileSiblings`), so every
 * entry is attached when it is recorded. It can still go stale DURING the walk,
 * because reactivating a script executes it synchronously and that code may
 * mutate the range. Two consequences, both deliberate. A node an earlier script
 * REMOVED is skipped, since `replaceWith` on a parentless node is a spec no-op.
 * A node an earlier script INSERTED is not visited, unlike the live walk this
 * replaced. That costs nothing reachable: such a node is connected by
 * definition, so the browser upgrades it on insertion, and `ensureUpgradeObserver`
 * catches it on the microtask regardless. Do NOT "restore" the live walk to
 * recover it. A correct live walk has to advance off the REPLACEMENT (advancing
 * off the detached original is bug #1102 itself), and in that form a script
 * appending a sibling script loops forever, each clone appending the next; it
 * would also re-run a script that already executed when its own creator
 * inserted it. The snapshot is additionally safer under a MOVE, since a live
 * walk would follow a node out of the range and start re-executing unrelated
 * scripts in the rest of the body.
