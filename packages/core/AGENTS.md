# AGENTS.md for @webjsdev/core

The webjs **core runtime**: `html` / `css` tagged templates, the
`WebComponent` base class, isomorphic renderers, directives, the
client router, the `Task` controller, the Context Protocol, and
testing helpers.

Framework-wide rules (workflow, JSDoc-in-`packages/`, no-build,
commit conventions, autonomous-mode behaviour, scaffold rules)
live in the **framework root [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)**
and apply here. Read that first.

This file only covers what's specific to `@webjsdev/core`.

## Role

Shared by every webjs runtime path:
- Server (SSR via `renderToString` / `renderToStream`).
- Browser (fine-grained client renderer + hydration).
- Tests (`renderToString` + `fixture()` helpers).

The same `html` / `css` tag and the same `WebComponent` class produce
the same output in all three.

## Module map (`src/`)

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `html.js` | `` html`` `` tagged-template → `TemplateResult`, plus `MARKER` and `isTemplate` |
| `css.js` | `` css`` `` → `CSSResult`, `adoptStyles`, `stylesToString` |
| `component.js` | `WebComponent` base class: lifecycle, properties, reactive accessors, light-vs-shadow DOM, scheduling, slot host wiring. On the server the base is a DOM shim (attribute methods backed by a Map, no-op events, inert `attachInternals`, `closest()` over the SSR ancestor chain, and the host IDL reflections `dataset` / `className` / `hidden` / `id` / `title` / `slot` / `role` / `tabIndex` / `aria*`); `performServerUpdate` runs the pre-render lifecycle (`willUpdate` + controllers' `hostUpdate` + reflection) for SSR. **Async render (#469):** `render()` may be async; when it returns a promise, `update()` routes to `_commitAsync` (stale-while-revalidate, a monotonic `__renderToken` race guard, rejection to the `renderError()` boundary) and `_performRender` defers the post-commit half (`hostUpdated`, `firstUpdated` / `updated`, `updateComplete`) until the commit lands via `_postCommit`. `renderFallback()` is the optional client re-fetch loading UI (re-fetch only, never first paint); `renderError()` is the per-component error boundary |
| `render-server.js` | `renderToString`, `renderToStream` (async, with Suspense streaming), SSR slot substitution in `injectDSD`. The walker seeds the server attribute shim from the source attributes, threads the enclosing-instance ancestor chain into each instance (so the shim's `closest()` resolves a parent), calls `performServerUpdate` before `render()`, and appends reflected/added attributes (including host attributes set inside `render()`) to the opening tag |
| `render-client.js` | Client-side patcher + hydration; the only file that touches `document`. Also discovers and binds light-DOM slot parts |
| `slot.js` | Light-DOM `<slot>` runtime: `HTMLSlotElement` polyfills (`assignedNodes`, `assignedElements`, `slotchange`), projection scheduling, MutationObserver, first-wins resolution, fallback swap, pending-fragment recovery |
| `directives.js` | the lit-html-parity directive set (`unsafeHTML`, `live`, `keyed`, `guard`, `templateContent`, `ref` / `createRef`, `cache`, `until`, `asyncAppend` / `asyncReplace`, `watch`, plus each `is*` guard). `repeat` lives in `repeat.js`. All are re-exported from `index.js` / `index-browser.js` so the bare specifier and the `/directives` subpath (which collapses onto the dist browser bundle) expose the full set |
| `repeat.js` | `repeat(items, keyFn, templateFn)` for keyed list reconciliation |
| `suspense.js` | `Suspense()` page/region-level boundary primitive |
| `webjs-suspense.js` | The `<webjs-suspense>` component-level streaming boundary element (#471). SSR (`render-server.js`) does the work: `injectDSD`'s `processSuspenseElements` pre-pass reads `.fallback` (carried as `data-webjs-fallback` by `renderTemplate`, since a TemplateResult is not serializer-safe) and, in a streaming context, flushes the fallback as `<webjs-suspense id="sN">` while pushing the children to `ctx.pending` for out-of-order streaming (concurrent across boundaries via `Promise.all`); without a streaming context the children render inline (blocking). This client element is layout-neutral (`display:contents`) and the registration home for the soft-nav apply; first-load streaming needs no client runtime (the inline swap script `replaceWith`s the boundary element with the resolved children, which then upgrade). Every swap path (the inline script, the boot `__webjsResolve`, and the soft-nav `applyStreamedResolve`) removes the transient wrapper, so a boundary settles to the same DOM however the page was reached. SSR-inert (defined client-side only) |
| `context.js` | Context Protocol: `createContext`, `ContextProvider`, `ContextConsumer`, `ContextRequestEvent` |
| `task.js` | `Task` / `TaskStatus` controller for async data in components |
| `router-client.js` | Turbo Drive–style client router; entry: `enableClientRouter` / `navigate`. Also exports `loadFrame(frameEl, url)` (#253), the reusable frame self-load `webjs-frame.js` calls: it fetches `url` as a frame nav (the `x-webjs-frame` header) and applies the matched subtree through the SAME `fetchAndApply` frame-swap path a click uses (no history push / snapshot / optimistic skeleton, since it swaps one region) |
| `webjs-frame.js` | The `<webjs-frame id>` custom element (a swap anchor; the router does the swap). Adds the `src` + `loading` self-load (#253): an eager (`connectedCallback`) or lazy (viewport, via `lazy-loader.js`'s `observeViewportOnce`) self-fetch through `router-client.js`'s `loadFrame`, with a per-element loaded-URL guard so eager connect / the lazy observer / a `src` mutation never double-fetch. SSR-inert (defined client-side only) |
| `webjs-stream.js` | The `<webjs-stream action target>` surgical-update element + `renderStream(payload)` (#248). The element self-applies its action on connect via native DOM (append / prepend / before / after / replace / update / remove against a `target` id or `targets` selector), cloning its single `<template>`, then removes itself. `renderStream(html)` parses a server payload and inserts the elements (they self-apply), so a live channel (`connectWS` / `broadcast`) reuses the SAME applier the HTTP path uses. `router-client.js` side-effect-imports this for app-wide registration and applies a content-negotiated `text/vnd.webjs-stream.html` form response through `renderStream` (sending the stream MIME in `Accept` only on a write, so a JS-off form degrades to a normal render). SSR-inert (defined client-side only) |
| `registry.js` | Custom-element bookkeeping (`register`, `lookup`, `allTags`, `tagOf`, `isLazy`, `primeModuleUrl`) |
| `lazy-loader.js` | IntersectionObserver-based lazy module loading for `static lazy = true`, plus `observeViewportOnce(el, cb)` (#253): a per-ELEMENT one-shot viewport callback (vs the per-tag module loader) reusing the same `rootMargin: '200px'` budget, used by `<webjs-frame loading="lazy">` to defer its self-load until the frame scrolls into view |
| `nav.js` | `notFound()`, `redirect()` sentinels for page/action handlers |
| `optimistic.js` | `optimistic()`, the optimistic-UI helper, in two shapes (#246, #799). DECLARATIVE (preferred): `optimistic(host, { source, update })` returns an `OptimisticState` whose `.value` is the merged view and whose `.add(payload, promise?)` queues an optimistic update that auto-releases when the promise settles. IMPERATIVE (legacy): `optimistic(signal, value, action)` sets the signal to `value`, awaits `action()`, and rolls back on a throw or an `ActionResult` `{ success: false }`. Both are re-exported from `index.js` + `index-browser.js` and classified in `component-elision.js` as a reactive (client-work) import |
| `action-stream.js` | Streaming RPC wire protocol (#489), isomorphic. The length-prefixed frame format (`[type:1][length:4 BE][payload]`, CHUNK / END / ERROR frame types, `STREAM_CONTENT_TYPE` = `application/vnd.webjs+stream`) shared by the server (which frames a streamed action result, `encodeFrame`) and the generated client stub (which decodes the body into an async iterable, `createFrameDecoder`, a stateful decoder buffering partial frames across network reads). Pure byte ops, no DOM / `node:*`, so it is safe in the browser bundle and on the server alike. An action that returns a `ReadableStream` / async iterable / async generator streams its chunks over one RPC response; each chunk is rich-serialized so a `Date` / `Map` / `BigInt` round-trips. Re-exported from `index.js` + `index-browser.js` |
| `action-seed-client.js` | Client consumer for SSR action-result seeding (#472): `takeSeed(hash, fn, argsKey)` (consume-once lookup, `SEED_MISS` sentinel) + `scanSeeds(root)` (ingest the page-level `#__webjs-seeds` JSON block and per-element `[data-webjs-seed]` carriers, stripping them). The generated RPC stub calls `takeSeed` before its `fetch`, so an async-render component's first client call resolves from the SSR seed instead of a hydration round-trip; `router-client.js`'s `applySwap` calls `scanSeeds` so a soft nav ingests seeds too. Inert server-side (DOM access only inside `scanSeeds`). Re-exported from `index.js` + `index-browser.js` |
| `escape.js` | HTML attribute / text escaping (the only sanitiser) |
| `csp-nonce.js` | Isomorphic CSP nonce reader: `cspNonce()` (returns the request nonce, `''` in the browser) + `setCspNonceProvider` (server-only wiring). The provider is installed by `@webjsdev/server`'s `context.js`; as of #233 it returns a freshly-MINTED per-request nonce (not just an inbound-header parse). `setCspNonceProvider` is stripped from the browser surface |
| `rich-fetch.js` | Content-negotiated fetch helper |
| `websocket-client.js` | `connectWS()` with auto-reconnect |
| `serialize.js` | Wire-format primitives (Date/Map/Set/BigInt/cycles…) used by RPC |
| `testing.js` | `fixture`, `ssrFixture` (SSR + hydrate, awaits the native `updateComplete`), `waitForUpdate` (awaits `updateComplete` when present), `assertNoA11yViolations` (opt-in axe-core a11y assertion, dynamically imports the test-only `axe-core` peer), `click`, `shadowQuery`, `shadowQueryAll` |

## Public exports (re-exported from `index.js`)

See the [package.json `exports` field](./package.json) for subpaths:
`@webjsdev/core/client`, `/server`, `/component`, `/registry`,
`/client-router`. Everything else is exposed via the main `index.js`
re-exports. Keep this list in sync if you add or remove a barrel
export.

**The `index.d.ts` overlay must declare every runtime named export** (it
drifted badly once, #388: 35 missing). This is now enforced:
`test/types/dts-export-coverage.test.mjs` reads each package's runtime
exports dynamically and tsc-checks that the `.d.ts` declares them all, so a
new `export` in `index.js` without a matching declaration fails CI. When you
add a runtime export, add its declaration (re-export from the source module's
`.d.ts`, creating that `.d.ts` if absent).

**Type-only exports.** `index.d.ts` (the overlay) re-exports the
type-only public surface alongside the runtime exports. The component
typing lives in `src/component.d.ts`; the page-metadata typing
(`Metadata`, `MetadataContext`, and the nested shapes, including
`PreconnectHint` for the `metadata.preconnect` / `metadata.dnsPrefetch`
connection-warming hints, #243) lives in
`src/metadata.d.ts`; the typed page / layout / route-handler props plus the
opt-in route union (`PageProps`, `LayoutProps`, `RouteHandlerContext`, `Route`,
`RouteParams`, and the `WebjsRoutes` / `RouteParamMap` augmentation targets,
#258) live in `src/routes.d.ts`. The `webjs` package.json config-block typing
(`WebjsConfig` plus the nested `WebjsHeaderRule` / `WebjsRedirectRule` /
`WebjsCspConfig` / `WebjsTrailingSlash`, #259) lives in
`src/webjs-config.d.ts`; it mirrors the `@webjsdev/server` config readers and
the companion JSON Schema (`packages/server/webjs-config.schema.json`), and
those three MUST stay in lockstep (the procedure is documented in
`packages/server/AGENTS.md`). The opt-in server-action serializability guard
(`Serializable`, `SerializableArgs`, `SerializableResult`, `SerializableActionFn`,
`NonSerializable`, #488) lives in `src/serializable.d.ts`: it maps a fully
serializable type to itself and a non-serializable position (a function / method)
to a branded marker, so an author who annotates an action with
`SerializableActionFn` gets a compile-time error on a non-serializable arg /
return instead of a silent wire loss. All are pure declaration files (erased at
runtime, zero build cost). A page imports them with `import type { Metadata,
PageProps } from '@webjsdev/core'`. The `Metadata` and `PageProps` /
`LayoutProps` shapes MUST stay in lockstep with what
`packages/server/src/ssr.js` actually reads / constructs, never Next.js's
superset. `routes.d.ts`'s `WebjsRoutes` / `RouteParamMap` are EMPTY by default
(so `Route = string`); `webjs types` generates `.webjs/routes.d.ts` to augment
them per app.

## Package-specific invariants

1. **No build step in your edit-and-refresh loop.** `.js` only,
   plain JSDoc types. What you grep in `node_modules/@webjsdev/core/
   src/` is what served as source IS what runs when the browser
   fetches per-file. Workspace dev (this monorepo) serves per-file
   from `packages/core/src/` until you opt into the bundle by
   running `npm run build:dist --workspace=@webjsdev/core`.
   Published-to-npm copies ship pre-built `dist/` bundles alongside
   `src/`; the browser fetches them when `dist/` is present
   (`scripts/build-framework-dist.js` is wired to the `prepare`
   lifecycle so `npm publish` always rebuilds). The browser surface is
   ONE self-contained file, `dist/webjs-core-browser.js` (built with
   `splitting` off, so no `chunk-*.js`): it re-exports the whole browser
   API, so the bare specifier and the `/directives`, `/context`,
   `/task`, `/client-router` subpaths all resolve to it. `dist/` also
   carries `webjs-core.js` (the full Node surface), the on-demand
   `webjs-core-lazy-loader.js`, and the test-only `webjs-core-testing.js`.
   Only `@webjsdev/core` has this dual-layout. Other framework packages
   stay source-only. `index-browser.js` (and its `dist/webjs-core-browser.js`
   build) strip `render-server.js` and
   `setCspNonceProvider` from the public surface. `packages/server/src/importmap.js` routes the
   bare specifier `@webjsdev/core` to that browser entry on the
   client side; Node-side consumers (SSR pipeline, framework
   internals, unit tests) keep landing on `index.js` via the
   package.json `default` condition and still see the full surface.
   `renderToString` / `renderToStream` are reachable from Node via
   the canonical `@webjsdev/core/server` subpath when an explicit
   import is desired.
2. **`html\`\`` returns an inert `TemplateResult`.** Templates don't
   touch the DOM until a renderer (server or client) consumes them.
3. **The renderer is the boundary between server and client.** Server
   code: `renderToString`, `renderToStream`. Client code: `render`.
   Never import client renderer code from server-only paths.
4. **Custom-element tags must contain a hyphen** (HTML spec). See
   `registry.js` `register()`. The framework convention validator
   enforces this.
5. **Reactive properties are declared via the base-class factory
   `extends WebComponent({ propName: Type })`** (the `prop()` helper
   carries options), with defaults set via the `default` option or the
   constructor, never class-field initializers (those clobber the
   framework's accessor under modern class-field semantics). A direct
   `static properties` block throws at runtime. See `component.js`, the
   `no-static-properties` rule, and `reactive-props-no-class-field`.
6. **New interactivity surfaces must update the elision analyser.**
   webjs elides display-only component modules from the browser by
   static analysis (`packages/server/src/component-elision.js`). It is a
   conservative denylist of interactivity signals. When you add a new
   overridable lifecycle hook, reactive primitive, or client-only
   directive to core, add its marker to the matching exported list in
   `component-elision.js` (`CLIENT_LIFECYCLE_HOOKS`, `CLIENT_METHOD_CALLS`,
   or `REACTIVE_IMPORTS`). When you add a new template binding SIGIL,
   register it in core's `BINDING_PREFIXES`
   (`packages/core/src/binding-prefixes.js`, the single source both
   renderers read) and classify it in `component-elision.js` as a
   client-behaviour ship signal (`SSR_DROPPED_PREFIXES`, like `@event`,
   which drops at SSR) or an SSR-safe round-trip (`ROUND_TRIP_PREFIXES`,
   like `.prop` / `?bool`, which survives into the served HTML). When you
   add an interactivity STATIC field, add it to
   `INTERACTIVITY_STATIC_FIELDS`. Skipping any of these lets the analyser
   wrongly elide a component that now does client work. Two guard tests
   fail until the new surface is classified:
   `packages/server/test/elision/lifecycle-coverage.test.js` (prototype
   methods and hooks) and `.../sigil-coverage.test.js` (binding sigils and
   static fields, asserting the classification partitions `BINDING_PREFIXES`
   exactly).
   Note (#474): an `async render()` is NOT, by itself, a ship signal. A
   bare async leaf (no other client signal, light DOM) is elided like any
   display-only component, since SSR bakes its data into the first paint.
   It ships only on an independent signal (the lists above, an `@event`, a
   non-`state` prop, a `<slot>`, cross-module observation, an interactive
   child) or one of the two static carve-outs in the
   `INTERACTIVITY_STATIC_FIELDS` registry: `static shadow = true`
   (Declarative Shadow DOM must re-attach on a client-side DOM insertion)
   and `static refresh = true` (the explicit opt-in to keep the on-load
   re-fetch). `renderFallback` stays a ship signal via
   `CLIENT_LIFECYCLE_HOOKS`.

7. **`<slot>` works identically in light and shadow DOM.** Light-DOM
   slots get the same `assignedNodes` / `assignedElements` /
   `assignedSlot` / `slotchange` surface, named slots, fallback content,
   and first-wins resolution as shadow-DOM slots. The light-DOM runtime
   in `slot.js` gates every polyfill on a `data-webjs-light` attribute,
   so real shadow-DOM slots elsewhere on the page are never touched.
   SSR (`injectDSD`) projects light-DOM children into the rendered
   template before the response goes out, so progressive enhancement
   and JS-disabled clients both see the projected content.

## Tests

Tests for this package live in **`packages/core/test/`**,
organised by feature: `signals/`, `rendering/`, `directives/`,
`slots/`, `lifecycle/`, `context/`, `task/`, `suspense/`,
`routing/`, `serializer/`, `styling/`, `registry/`, `nav/`,
`websocket-client/`, `rich-fetch/`, `seed/`. Each feature folder has a
`browser/` subfolder when there are real-browser tests for it (run on
Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit via web-test-runner).

Cross-package tests that exercise core through the SSR pipeline
or scaffolds live at the repo root in `test/ssr/`,
`test/scaffolds/`, etc. See [`../../agent-docs/testing.md`](../../agent-docs/testing.md).

Run `npm test` from the repo root for node tests, `npm run test:browser`
for the browser tests.
