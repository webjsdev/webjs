/**
 * Real-browser test for #1436: `data-preserve-scroll` on a link or form keeps
 * the reader's scroll offset across a forward navigation, while an unmarked one
 * still scrolls to top.
 *
 * A forward navigation always scrolled to the top and an author had no way to
 * say otherwise. That default is right, but it is wrong for a filter, sort, or
 * tab link whose control sits below the fold, and for a form that re-renders in
 * place with validation errors: the reader is thrown away from the thing they
 * were just looking at.
 *
 * This MUST run in a real browser. linkedom implements no layout and no
 * scrolling at all, so `window.scrollY` never moves there and every position
 * assertion below would pass vacuously. The unit file covers attribute
 * RESOLUTION only, and says so.
 *
 * Fixture rules, carried over from `frame-swap-scroll.test.js` (#1427). Each is
 * load-bearing and each is easy to get wrong in a way that leaves the test green
 * either way:
 *
 *   - The page has to be TALL and stay tall across the swap, so the response
 *     carries its own spacer. A swap that shortens the document clamps
 *     `scrollY` to 0 on its own and looks exactly like the defect.
 *   - The starting offset has to be non-zero and asserted BEFORE the click. A
 *     fixture that never managed to scroll would report 0 afterwards for the
 *     wrong reason.
 *   - Every href keeps the page's OWN query string, which identifies the
 *     web-test-runner session. A link that replaces the search string pushes the
 *     page out of its session and takes down the entire run, with every test
 *     still passing, so it reads as an infrastructure blip.
 *   - The response repeats the live boundary KEY. A different key shares no
 *     boundary with the live DOM, so the router degrades to a full page load
 *     rather than swapping, and the case would assert scroll behaviour on a
 *     navigation that never applied.
 *   - `scroll-behavior` is forced off: the assertions are about position, and a
 *     smooth scroll would not have landed by the time they run (#601).
 *
 * COUNTERFACTUALS, each RUN and proven to red the cases it names, and every one
 * of them re-run at commit `b360fb7d`. A counterfactual claim is true of a
 * commit rather than of a branch, so re-run the toggle and restate this list if
 * a later commit touches the scroll block or the resolver. That is not a
 * hypothetical caution: the submitter-to-form fallback silently falsified the
 * `closest()` bullet below and took the only coverage of the walk with it, so
 * the two failed together and neither was visible from a green suite.
 *
 *   - delete the `!preserveScroll` guard in `fetch-apply.js`: cases 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
 *   - gate the WHOLE `if (recordHistory && !frameId)` block on `!preserveScroll`
 *     instead: case 5 (the hash carve-out is what that breaks)
 *   - drop the `closest()` walk to a bare `hasAttribute`: case 3 ONLY. This
 *     bullet used to name case 6 as well, on the reasoning that a marked
 *     `<form>` reaching its own submit BUTTON proved the walk. Adding the
 *     submitter-to-form fallback made that false: case 6 now resolves through
 *     the fallback and stays green under this toggle, so there IS a second
 *     lookup and case 6 no longer distinguishes the walk from it. The
 *     contained-submitter walk is pinned at the unit layer instead, by the
 *     marked-`<fieldset>`-inside-an-unmarked-form assertion in
 *     `../router-client.test.js`, which the fallback cannot rescue.
 *   - drop the `!== 'false'` test so presence alone preserves: case 4
 *   - read the option as `!opts?.scroll` rather than `opts?.scroll === false`:
 *     case 7's optionless half, plus 3 assertions in the unit file
 *   - delete the `!frameId` half of the `if (recordHistory && !frameId)` guard
 *     (the #1427 frame rule): case 8's UNMARKED half. Its MARKED half stays
 *     green, which is why both halves are there; see the note on that case.
 *   - drop the `|| findScrollCarrier(fallback)` fallback in `scroll.js`: case 9
