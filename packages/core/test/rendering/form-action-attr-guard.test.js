// and `formaction` on a submit button), plus the byte-identical passthrough
// for string-valued action attributes.
//
// #1155 later made ONE of those shapes meaningful rather than merely refused:
// an unquoted `action=${fn}` on a `<form>` binds the action. It still cannot
// stringify anything, so the security claim is unchanged, but the refusal it
// hits is now the identity one ("is not a server action") for a function the

/**
 * Drain a stream into a CALLER-OWNED buffer, so what the consumer RECEIVED
 * survives a throw.
 *
 * `drain()` accumulates into a local and loses it when the iteration throws, so
 * a test that drains a refused render and then inspects the result is always
 * inspecting an empty string, whatever the consumer actually got. "It threw" is
 * not the same claim as "the client received nothing".
 *
 * Issues a large SYNCHRONOUS burst of reads, and fails loudly if the burst was
 * not big enough. Four wrong answers preceded this, so the mechanism is worth
 * stating exactly rather than by analogy.
 *
 * Chunks written while the `new ReadableStream` constructor is still running
 * land in the queue that `controller.error()` later clears, and that is the
 * path that matters here: for the template below, and for the patched machine
 * the ladder was measured on, every chunk is written during the constructor.
 * (A second path exists, since `streamTemplate` awaits at text holes and a
 * chunk written after the constructor returns goes straight to a pending read.
 * A three-hole template splits 2 in the constructor and 4 after. No template in
 * this file has a text hole, so it plays no part in any of the numbers below,
 * and it is mentioned only because two earlier versions of this note explained
 * the behaviour with whichever path they happened to be wrong about.)
 *
 * Either way the recovery is per read: N reads issued in one synchronous run
 * recover N chunks. So consumers form a ladder with no top, measured against a
 * machine patched to flush its buffer, enqueue pad chunks, enqueue the source,
 * then refuse:
 *
 *   for await                    the prefix alone
 *   sequential getReader() loop  the prefix and one more chunk
 *   burst of N                   N chunks in total
 *
 * Any FIXED burst is therefore guessable: a batch of 16 silently passed a leak
 * sitting behind 20 pad chunks. The bound cannot be removed, since the burst is
 * sized before anything is awaited, so instead running out of it is made a hard
 * failure rather than a clean-looking drain.
 *
 * Worth being blunt about what this buys on the SHIPPED path: nothing. The
 * template the caller below uses has a single attribute hole and no text hole,
 * so the guard refuses before anything is enqueued at all, and instrumenting
 * the controller records exactly one event, the error. `sink.text` is therefore
 * always empty there, and both assertions hold trivially. All of this machinery
 * exists for the counterfactual, where a regression that writes before refusing
 * DOES enqueue, and where the difference between draining well and draining
 * badly is the difference between catching that and waving it through.
 *
 * @param {any} stream
 * @param {{ text: string }} sink written to as chunks arrive
