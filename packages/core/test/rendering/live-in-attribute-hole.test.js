// #1443: SSR must resolve `live()` in an ATTRIBUTE hole, not just a child hole.
//
// `live()` exists to dirty-check a commit against the LIVE DOM value, which is
// a client-only concern, so on the server the directive is transparent and every
// position must see the inner value. It was resolved only in child position
// (`render()` / `streamRender()`), so the wrapper object reached the attribute
// emit sites raw and each kind failed its own way:
//
//   ?bool  the wrapper is truthy, so `?open=${live(false)}` emitted `open=""`
//   attr   `String(val ?? '')` stringified the wrapper to `[object Object]`
//   .prop  the wrapper itself was serialized into `data-webjs-prop-*`
//
// The falsy-bool case is the one that shipped: webjs.dev's `<details>` nav menu
// bound `?open=${live(this.open)}`, so mobile painted the menu OPEN and
// hydration then closed it.
//
// The client (render-client/parts.js `applyPart`) has always unwrapped `live()`
// once, before its attr/bool/prop dispatch, and render-client/reconciler.js
// `effectiveFormAttr` simulates SSR by calling `resolveHoleValue` (which
// unwraps) while its docstring claims to "mirror render-server.js exactly". So
// this was a direct contradiction between the two renderers, and the fix is to
// unwrap at the same single point on the server.
//
// Both server machines are asserted on every case: the buffered renderer
// (`renderToString`) and the streaming one (`renderToStream(v, {ssr:false})`)
// are separate hole-dispatch sites that must not drift.
