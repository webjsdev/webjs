// #1154, client half: the browser renderer refuses the same commit, so a
// client re-render can never write a function's source into the live DOM.
// Runs under linkedom.
//
// Four `applyPart` clauses guard this, and the tests below pin all four.
// Established by neutering each one separately, not by reading, because which
// clause a given hole shape reaches is not what it looks like:
//
//   'attr'       unquoted `action=${fn}`, including an array-wrapped value
//   'attr-mixed' EVERY quoted single hole (`action="${fn}"`, `.action="${fn}"`,
//                `?action="${fn}"`, `@action="${fn}"`) plus a true mixed value
//   'prop'       unquoted `.action=${fn}` on an element that REFLECTS it
//                (a form, or `.formAction` on a button/input); elsewhere the
//                property is an expando and is deliberately left alone
//   'bool'       unquoted `?action=${fn}`
//
// The second row is the counter-intuitive one: quoting a hole does not keep it
// in the 'attr' case, it moves it to 'attr-mixed'.
