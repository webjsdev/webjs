/**
 * The gallery's demo index, ONE source of truth for both the home cards and the
 * left sidebar (so they can never drift). A browser-safe data module (no server
 * imports, no client globals): the home flattens the groups into its card grid,
 * and <gallery-nav> renders them grouped. gallery:clear removes this module.
 *
 * Blurbs are INTENT-shaped, not noun-shaped: each one opens on the job you would
 * be doing when you want this demo, because the index is the first thing an
 * agent reads and a card that only names the feature cannot be found by someone
 * who does not know the feature exists.
