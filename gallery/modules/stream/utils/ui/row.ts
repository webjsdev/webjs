// A feature-local VIEW FRAGMENT: pure, returns markup, used only by the stream
// demo. It lives in `modules/<feature>/utils/ui/` rather than `utils/` (which
// holds helpers returning DATA) or `components/` (which holds custom elements).
// See https://webjs.dev/docs/styling.
//
// WHY a fragment and not a display-only <stream-row> element: an element is a
// tag in the DOM, and neither caller can carry one. The list wants a direct
// `<ul> > <li>` child, so a wrapper would break that selector and the list
// semantics; and <webjs-stream> takes its payload as an HTML STRING, which no
// component can return. That is the test, not bytes: where a wrapper element is
// harmless, reach for the component instead.
//
// Hence the two shapes below, off one class list, so the streamed row and the
// seeded rows cannot drift apart. That drift was live: the class list used to
// exist three times in this feature, once in a `rowCls` const and twice inlined
// in the component's own template, which did not use the const.
