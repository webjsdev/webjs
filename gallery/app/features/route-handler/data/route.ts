// A route.ts is a server-only HTTP handler (named GET / POST / PUT / PATCH /
// DELETE exports). It is NOT isomorphic and never ships to the client, the webjs
// equivalent of a Next route handler. A folder cannot have BOTH page.ts and
// route.ts, so this endpoint lives one segment deeper, at
// /features/route-handler/data.
//
// `json(data)` (from @webjsdev/server) responds with the WebJs rich serializer,
// so a `Date` (or Map / Set / BigInt) round-trips as its real type when the
// caller uses `richFetch` (see modules/route-handler/components/rich-data.ts).
// The request accessors read the IN-FLIGHT request from context: `headers()`,
// `cookies()`, and `requestId()` take no argument (they read the active
// request), while `clientIp(req)` and `readBody(req)` take it explicitly.

    // did, and bucketed proxies instead of visitors). `ip` is the socket peer,
    // which is the visitor only when the browser connects to you directly.
    // `forwardedIp` is what the visitor's own CDN header says, which is what a
    // limiter or an audit log wants. Deployed behind Cloudflare and Railway,
