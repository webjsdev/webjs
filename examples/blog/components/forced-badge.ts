/**
 * The forced-badge element is purely presentational: static markup, no
 * events, no reactive properties, no lifecycle hooks, no signals, no slot,
 * light DOM. Every property of it says display-only, so the framework would
 * elide its module from the browser.
 *
 * The one thing that keeps it on the wire is `static interactive = true`, the
 * explicit author override for interactivity static analysis cannot see. It
 * exists to e2e-pin that override: until now the only coverage stopped at the
 * analyser returning a boolean, and nothing proved the boot script actually
 * keeps the module. The e2e probe asserts the browser downloads THIS module on
 * a run where the unobserved build-stamp element is still not downloaded, so
 * the assertion cannot pass because elision stopped working altogether.
