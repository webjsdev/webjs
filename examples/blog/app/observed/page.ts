/**
 * `/observed` renders a display-only `<observed-badge>` AND a shipping
 * `<forced-badge>` whose module imports one that observes the badge's
 * registration via `whenDefined` (a page never loads in the browser, so the
 * observer rides a component). The observation
 * forces the otherwise-elidable badge to ship, so the e2e probe can assert
 * the browser actually downloads `observed-badge.ts`.
 *
 * It also renders `<forced-badge>`, the same shape forced by the explicit
 * `static interactive = true` override instead of by observation, so one
 * probe covers both routes to a ship (#1308).
