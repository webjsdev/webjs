/**
 * Form-action e2e fixture (#1155): the no-JS write path.
 *
 * A `<form action=${submitFeedback}>` on `/feedback` posts to that page's own
 * url, and this action runs. Invalid input re-renders the SAME page (422) with
 * a field error and the user's typed value preserved; valid input redirects
 * (303 PRG) to `/feedback/thanks`. Works with JavaScript disabled, and the
 * client router upgrades it to an in-place swap when JS is on. No fetch
 * handler, no form library.
 *
 * Kept intentionally minimal and self-contained so the e2e probe can assert the
 * headline behavior in a real browser with JS both off and on.
