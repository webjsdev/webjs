/**
 * Per-submitter form-action e2e fixture (#1207), the form-level default.
 *
 * `/feedback/triage` binds this action on the `<form>` itself, so it runs when
 * the form is submitted by anything that does not name its own action: the
 * "Save draft" button, or a bare Enter in the text field.
 *
 * It reports WHICH action ran, because the whole point of the per-button
 * binding is that a different one runs for a different button, and "the form
 * submitted successfully" cannot tell those apart.
