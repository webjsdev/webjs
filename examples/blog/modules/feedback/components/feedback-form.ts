/**
 * A bound form inside a SHIPPING component (#1155).
 *
 * The plain `/feedback` page never hydrates, so its form is whatever SSR
 * emitted and the client renderer is never involved. This component is the
 * other half, and it is the shape the scaffold's todo gallery uses: it binds
 * `action=${submitFeedback}` AND carries interactivity, so it ships, hydrates,
 * and re-renders its whole template in the browser.
 *
 * The `rows` repeater is what makes the client half OBSERVABLE rather than
 * merely present. Hydrating the SSR'd form only PATCHES the markup the server
 * already sent, identity field included, so an assertion on it passes whether
 * or not the client reconcile ran. A row added in the browser has no SSR'd
 * markup to inherit: its form is built entirely by the client renderer, which
 * has to drop the `action` attribute, supply `method` / `enctype`, and build
 * the hidden identity field from the identity the GENERATED RPC stub stamps on
 * itself. If anything stopped the browser-served stub carrying that stamp, this
 * component's render would throw in the browser and the card would go blank,
 * while every node-side suite stayed green (they all hand-stamp a stand-in).
 *
 * The `@submit` handler only counts attempts; it does not preventDefault, so
 * every row submits through the normal path and works with JS off. With JS off
 * the repeater button does nothing and the SSR'd first row is the whole form,
 * which is the progressive-enhancement claim.
