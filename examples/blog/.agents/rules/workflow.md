# Antigravity Workspace Rules: webjs app

You are working on a webjs app, an AI-first, no-build, web-components-first
framework. Read AGENTS.md for the full API reference and CONVENTIONS.md for
project-specific conventions before writing any code. When AGENTS.md does not
cover what you need, the full hosted docs are at **https://docs.webjs.com**.

## Persistence + scaffold rules (non-negotiable)

- **Use Drizzle + SQLite for data, never JSON files.** It is already wired up
  (`db/schema.server.ts`, `db/connection.server.ts`, `npm run db:generate` + `npm run db:migrate`). For
  ANY data the app stores (todos, posts, messages, products, comments), define
  a Drizzle table. NEVER create `data/*.json`, `db.json`, or any JSON file as a
  fake database. NEVER use module-scope arrays / Maps as a substitute. NEVER
  use localStorage for app data. These are project conventions in
  CONVENTIONS.md (a JSON file used as a database resets on reload and
  cannot scale).
- **The scaffold is reference, not the final product.** Replace `app/page.ts`,
  the example `User` model, the example users module, etc. with the app the
  user actually asked for. Do not ship "Hello from <app-name>" as the
  deliverable.
- **Only three templates exist:** `webjs create <name>` (default full-stack),
  `--template api`, `--template saas`. The CLI rejects any other `--template`
  value. Pick:
  - Any product UI (todo, blog, dashboard, marketplace, social) goes through
    the default template.
  - HTTP/JSON API only, no UI, uses `--template api`.
  - Auth / login / signup / SaaS uses `--template saas`.

## Before starting ANY work

FIRST, before writing any code:
1. Check `git branch --show-current`.
   - If on main/master: create a feature branch before editing.
   - If on a feature branch: verify it matches the current task.
2. Sync: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` if behind.

## Autonomous mode (sandbox / no-prompt)

If running without interactive approval, auto-decide:
- On main? Auto-create feature/<task-slug> branch.
- Parent behind? Auto-rebase. Merge? Auto-merge + delete feature branches.
- Auto-generate commit messages. Fix failing tests and violations.
Quality bar stays the same, no blocking on questions.

## Mandatory workflow (never skip)

Every code change must include:
1. Server tests in `test/<feature>/*.test.ts` (node:test).
2. Browser tests in `test/<feature>/browser/*.test.js` (WTR + Playwright, real Chromium).
3. Documentation updates. Walk every surface in the **Definition of done**
   section of CONVENTIONS.md (AGENTS.md, CONVENTIONS.md, README.md, docs/,
   website/, scaffold scripts) and either update it or write
   "N/A because <reason>" in the PR body. Docs land on the same PR as the
   code, never as a follow-up.
4. Convention check: `webjs check` must pass.
5. Pre-merge self-review loop. Before saying the PR is ready for merge, run
   fresh-context review rounds until one round finds zero issues. Antigravity
   primitive: open a new Cascade thread or a fresh side-panel session for
   each round so the reviewer has no prior context on the implementation
   decisions. Minimum two rounds; rotate focus each round. Skip the loop
   only for one-line trivial changes; skipping on a change that touches
   logic, public surface, build, security, or multiple files is the exact
   failure mode the loop exists to prevent. The full rule, prompt template,
   and reporting contract live in the **Pre-merge self-review loop** section
   of CONVENTIONS.md.

The user should never have to ask for tests, documentation, or the
self-review loop.

## Git rules

- COMMIT AND PUSH PER LOGICAL UNIT, NOT AT THE END. One feature, one fix, one
  rename, one doc rewrite per commit. Always `git push` after committing.
  The user should never have to ask for a commit.
- HARD LIMIT: if you have 5+ unstaged files spanning different concerns,
  commit before continuing. The Claude Code hook at
  `.claude/hooks/nudge-uncommitted.sh` fires at threshold 4. Antigravity
  users should self-enforce the same rule. Batching multiple logical units
  into one commit is the failure mode this rule exists to prevent.
- Meaningful commit messages: what changed and why.
- NEVER add Co-Authored-By or AI attribution trailers to commits.
- NEVER use em-dashes (U+2014), a hyphen-as-pause (` - `), or a
  semicolon-as-pause (` ; `) in commit messages or anywhere else. Rewrite the
  sentence so no pause-punctuation crutch is needed. Use a period, comma,
  colon, parentheses, or a restructured phrasing. Plain hyphens stay fine in
  compound words, CLI flags, filenames, and ranges. Semicolons stay fine
  inside code.
- Work on feature branches, never push directly to main.
- Create pull requests for review.
- NEVER merge any branch without explicit user permission. Always ask:
  "Ready to merge <branch> into <target>? Delete or keep <branch> after?"
  Wait for approval AND the delete/keep preference. Applies to ALL merges.
- Run `webjs test` before every commit.

## Framework rules

- No build step: ES modules served directly.
- **Erasable TypeScript only.** The runtime (Node 24+ or Bun) strips types via
  `module.stripTypeScriptTypes` (whitespace replacement, byte-exact position
  preservation, no sourcemap). The scaffold's `tsconfig.json` sets
  `erasableSyntaxOnly: true`, so the TS compiler rejects `enum`, `namespace`
  with values, constructor parameter properties, legacy decorators with
  `emitDecoratorMetadata`, and `import = require`. Use erasable equivalents:
  `const X = { ... } as const` plus a derived union type instead of `enum`;
  explicit fields plus constructor body assignments instead of parameter
  properties. If `erasableSyntaxOnly` is disabled and non-erasable syntax is
  used, the dev server fails at strip time and returns a 500 pointing at the
  `no-non-erasable-typescript` lint rule. webjs is buildless end-to-end and
  has no bundler fallback.
- Web components render into light DOM by default (so Tailwind / global CSS
  apply directly). Opt in to shadow DOM per component with
  `static shadow = true` when you need scoped styles (via
  `static styles = css\`...\``) or third-party-embed isolation. `<slot>`
  projection works identically in both modes (named slots, fallback content,
  `assignedNodes` / `slotchange`, first-wins resolution).
- Custom-element tag names are passed to `.register('tag-name')`. They are NOT
  a static field on the class.
- One function per server action file (`*.server.ts`).
- Server-only code (a DB driver like `better-sqlite3`/`pg`, `node:*`, anything that needs Node APIs)
  goes only in `.server.{js,ts}` files, `route.ts` handlers, or
  `middleware.ts`. Never in pages, layouts, or components. Wrap the access in
  a `.server.{js,ts}` file; the framework rewrites that import into an RPC
  stub for the browser. `lib/` holds both server-only infra
  (the DB in `db/*.server.ts`) and browser-safe utilities (`lib/utils/cn.ts` with
  `cn`); follow the same rule per file.
- Directives: webjs exports the lit directives with no clean native equivalent
  (`repeat`, `unsafeHTML`, `live`, `keyed`, `guard`, `cache`, `until`, `ref` /
  `createRef`, `templateContent`, `asyncAppend` / `asyncReplace`, `watch`).
  `classMap` / `styleMap` / `ifDefined` / `when` / `choose` are NOT exported.
  For those, use plain template-literal expressions
  (`class=${active ? 'btn active' : 'btn'}`, `style=${'color:' + color}`,
  `${cond ? a : b}`) and lifecycle hooks (`this.query('#el')` in
  `firstUpdated`) instead of Lit's `classMap` / `styleMap` / `ref` / `when` /
  `choose` / `guard`.
- Use Context for cross-component data, Task for async data in components.
- **Progressive enhancement is the default.** Pages AND every web component
  are SSR'd to real HTML. Write components so the first paint is the right
  content. Read SSR-meaningful defaults in `constructor()`. `connectedCallback`
  is never called on the server, so anything there only runs after
  hydration. Initial data for components comes from the page function
  (server-side fetch plus pass as attribute/property), NOT from `fetch` calls
  in `connectedCallback`. For write-paths, prefer `<form action=...>` plus
  server action over `fetch` plus click handler. The framework upgrades plain
  forms to partial-swap submissions automatically.
- **Client navigation is auto-magic.** Real `<a href>` and `<form action>`
  get partial-swap behavior with no opt-in. Because layouts persist across
  navigation, put shared chrome (sidenav, header) in `layout.ts` and
  page-specific content in `page.ts`. For validation errors, return 4xx HTML
  from a `route.ts` POST handler; the router renders it in place preserving
  the user's input. For non-layout swap regions, wrap in `<webjs-frame id="...">`. See "Client
  navigation patterns" in AGENTS.md.
