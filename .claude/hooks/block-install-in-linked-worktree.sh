# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash): BLOCK an install command aimed at a directory
# whose `node_modules` is a SYMLINK. In this repo that link points at the
# PRIMARY checkout's tree, so the install acts on a checkout you are not working
# in and the failure surfaces in someone else's session (#1442).
#
# Why a hook rather than a `preinstall` script. Measured on npm 11.19.0 and bun
# 1.3.14, no package-manager lifecycle hook can prevent the damage:
#   npm install  REPLACES the symlink with a real directory before `preinstall`
#                runs, so a guard there never sees a symlink at all
#   npm ci       DELETES the symlink's target, the whole of the primary's
#                node_modules, before `preinstall` runs
#   bun install  runs `preinstall` in time but IGNORES a non-zero exit
# A PreToolUse hook is the only layer that sees the state before the package
# manager starts. `scripts/warn-worktree-install.mjs` covers every other tool by
# reporting rather than blocking.
#
# ## How the matching works, and why it is shaped this way
#
# Recognising a package-manager invocation inside an arbitrary shell command is
# the hard part of this hook, and getting it wrong in either direction is
# expensive: a false NEGATIVE lets the corruption through, and a false POSITIVE
# fires on ordinary commands in a linked worktree, which is the mandated working
# state here, until someone turns the gate off. Four passes of review found a
# defect in each direction, so the matcher is built in explicit stages:
#
#   1. QUOTED SPANS ARE REMOVED FIRST. A manager invocation never has its own
#      name inside quotes, while ordinary commands carry shell metacharacters
#      there constantly. Splitting the raw string instead makes
#      `git commit -m "fix: the link; npm install now blocks"` look like two
#      commands, the second an install.
#   2. The remainder is split on `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `(`, `)` and newlines.
#   3. Each segment is judged by its FIRST token, after leading env assignments
#      and wrappers are stripped. A segment that does not START with a package
#      manager is not an install, whatever else it contains.
#   4. Only inside a manager-led segment are the remaining tokens scanned, and
#      the FIRST one recognised as either an install verb or a known safe verb
#      decides. Anything unrecognised is skipped rather than assumed, so a flag
#      VALUE (`npm -w packages/core install`) does not hide the verb behind it.
#
# Contract: exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block (message on stderr).
# Escape hatch: WEBJS_NO_WORKTREE_INSTALL_GATE=1.

# Verbs that WRITE to node_modules. Every manager's documented aliases, because
# a gate `bun i` walks past is worthless and Bun is the manager that writes
# THROUGH the link rather than replacing it. `link`, `rebuild` and `prune` are
# here for the same reason as the remove verbs: they all mutate the tree that
# the symlink points at.
# PER MANAGER, not one merged list. Merging them blocked `npm --workspace a run
# build`, because `a` is a BUN alias for `add`, and blocked `bun upgrade`, which
# upgrades the Bun BINARY and never touches node_modules.
#
# The one-letter aliases `a` and `r` are deliberately omitted from npm's list.
# They are rare as commands and common as flag VALUES, and the scan cannot tell
# the two apart, so admitting them blocks `npm -w a run build`. KNOWN GAP: `npm
# r <pkg>` and `npm a <pkg>` are therefore not blocked. That is the deliberate
# trade, because the false positive lands on an ordinary command while the false
# negative lands on a spelling almost nobody types, and the repair, report and
# doctor layers still catch the damage after the fact.

# STAGE 1: neutralise quoted spans and drop heredoc bodies.
#
# A quoted span must keep its CONTENT (a quoted path is the ordinary defensive
# spelling of `cd "<worktree>" && npm ci`, which is the arrival shape this hook
# exists for) while losing its power to look like a command boundary. So the
# quote characters are removed and only the SEPARATORS inside them are
# neutralised. Deleting the whole span instead loses the path and fails open.
#
# It is a character-by-character state machine rather than a pair of seds
# because quote nesting has to be tracked: an apostrophe inside a double-quoted
# string is literal, and a sed pass over `'...'` first would pair it with the
# next single quote in the line and swallow whatever sat between.
#
# A heredoc BODY is not commands. This repo's docs are full of `npm install`
# lines, and `cat > doc.md <<'EOF'` ... `EOF` must not read as an install.
