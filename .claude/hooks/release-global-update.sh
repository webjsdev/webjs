# Claude Code PostToolUse hook (matcher: Bash).
#
# After a RELEASE PR (a canonical "chore: release <pkgs>" title) merges,
# the just-published packages are live on npm a minute or two later. The globally
# installed `webjs` CLI (used to scaffold / dogfood) then lags the release. This
# hook fires on that merge and injects a directive to update the global CLI on
# BOTH package managers once the publish is confirmed:
#
#   npm update -g webjsdev
#   bun add -g webjsdev
#   mise use -g npm:webjsdev@latest
#
# It REMINDS rather than runs, on purpose: those commands pull the LATEST
# PUBLISHED version, so they must run AFTER `.github/workflows/release.yml`
# publishes (verify with `npm view @webjsdev/cli version`), not at merge time.
# Only fires for a release PR (a normal PR merge is ignored). Needs `gh`.
# Disable with WEBJS_NO_RELEASE_GLOBAL_UPDATE=1.
#
# Rule: the "Update global CLI after a release" memory + the release flow in
# framework-dev.md.

A release PR just merged. Once .github/workflows/release.yml has published the
new versions to npm (verify with `npm view @webjsdev/cli version` matching the
released version), update the globally installed CLI on BOTH package managers so
local scaffolding / dogfooding uses the new release:
  npm update -g webjsdev
  bun add -g webjsdev
  mise use -g npm:webjsdev@latest
Run all three AFTER the publish is confirmed, not before (they pull the latest
PUBLISHED version). The `mise use` line is the one that actually moves a
mise-shimmed `webjs` (verify with `mise which webjs`). Disable this reminder with
WEBJS_NO_RELEASE_GLOBAL_UPDATE=1.
