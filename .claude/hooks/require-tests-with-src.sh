# PreToolUse hook: block a `git commit` that changes framework source
# without touching any test, and reject commits that look like they strip
# tests to slip past the gate. Deterministic floor for the project rule
# "every code change ships with tests" (AGENTS.md "Definition of done").
#
# What a hook CANNOT do: know which test LAYER a change needs (unit vs
# browser vs e2e is a judgement call). So it enforces the floor (a real
# test change must accompany source) and, for client/browser-facing
# source, injects a reminder naming the layers to cover. The substantive
# check (do the tests exercise the behaviour, are they green, were any
# silently removed) stays the reviewer/test-audit step in AGENTS.md.
#
# Scope: only fires on `git commit` Bash calls. Inspects the STAGED diff
# (what the commit records), so `git add` choices drive it.
#
# Blocks (exit 2) when EITHER:
#   1. The staged diff modifies `packages/*/src/**` but stages no test
#      file (`**/test/**`, `*.test.*`, or `*.spec.*`), OR
#   2. The staged test files have a net-negative line count while source
#      also changes (a signal tests were trimmed to pass), unless
#      WEBJS_ALLOW_TEST_REMOVAL=1 marks an intentional test refactor.
#
# Allowed (exit 0): commits touching no `packages/*/src/**`; commits that
# stage tests alongside source; and WEBJS_NO_TEST_GATE=1 for a genuine
# one-off. (`git commit --no-verify` also skips it, but the messages name
# the env escape hatches since this is a PreToolUse hook, not git's own.)
#
# Rule: AGENTS.md "Definition of done" plus the test-audit reviewer step.

BLOCKED: this commit changes framework source but stages no test.

Staged source under packages/*/src/** with no accompanying test file.
Every code change ships with tests (AGENTS.md "Definition of done"). Add
or update the test that proves the new behaviour, then `git add` it.

Walk the layers the change can affect, do NOT stop at unit:
  unit:    packages/*/test/** , test/**
  browser: */test/**/browser/*   (hydration, client render, DOM, router)
  e2e:     test/e2e/*.test.mjs    (full stack, network probes, navigation)
  smoke:   test/examples/*/smoke/*   (example apps still serve)
  bun:     node scripts/run-bun-tests.js + test/bun/*.mjs   (cross-runtime;
           required for serializer / listener / streams / crypto / node:* changes)

For a client-router / component / browser-facing change a unit test is
necessary but NOT sufficient. Add the browser and/or e2e coverage that
asserts the real behaviour (for example a network probe that a fetch did
or did not happen).

Genuine non-code commit (pure docs, release bump) that needs no test?
Re-run with WEBJS_NO_TEST_GATE=1.

BLOCKED: this commit removes more test lines than it adds (+$added / -$deleted).

A net reduction in tests alongside a source change is the signature of
tests trimmed to pass. If this is a real test refactor or files moving,
re-run with WEBJS_ALLOW_TEST_REMOVAL=1. Otherwise add the coverage back.
