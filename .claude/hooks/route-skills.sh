# UserPromptSubmit hook: route every prompt to the skills it matches, so a
# relevant skill is never silently skipped.
#
# Why this exists: a Skill is model-invoked. It fires only when the model
# judges the request to match the skill's triggers, and that judgement can
# be wrong. In one session a "can we add prefetch, verify in the remix
# repo, let me know" request was treated as pure research, so the
# webjs-file-issue workflow was skipped and code investigation started with
# no tracked issue. Skill descriptions and AGENTS.md prose are advisory;
# only a hook is deterministic. This hook closes the gap the same way the
# em-dash hook does: it runs on every prompt, decides from the prompt TEXT
# (not from model judgement), and injects a high-priority directive.
#
# What it can and cannot do (verified against the Claude Code hooks
# reference): a hook CANNOT invoke a Skill tool-call itself. The strongest
# deterministic lever is UserPromptSubmit additionalContext, injected as a
# system reminder the model reads before acting. So this hook does two
# things on every webjs prompt:
#
#   1. KEYWORD ROUTING. Match the prompt against each skill's documented
#      triggers. For each hit, name the skill and direct that it be
#      invoked via the Skill tool BEFORE any other work.
#   2. STANDING RULE. Always inject the generic policy: before acting,
#      check the available skills and invoke any whose purpose matches the
#      request, because skills encode required workflow. This catches the
#      case keyword routing misses, where a research or design request
#      turns into tracked work mid-stream.
#
# The rule is generic across ALL skills by design. It is NOT a rule about
# any single skill or about filing GitHub issues specifically; it enforces
# that whatever the matching skill says is followed.
#
# Output contract: print one JSON object with
# hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext and exit 0. The hook never blocks a
# prompt (exit 2 would erase it); routing must inform, not gate, since the
# model still owns the Skill call.

webjs skill policy (enforced, read before acting):
Before doing the work in this prompt, check the available skills. If the
request matches ANY skill's purpose, you MUST invoke that skill via the
Skill tool BEFORE other work. Skills encode required project workflow;
skipping a matching skill is a policy violation, not a shortcut. This holds
even when the prompt reads as research, a question, or a design ask but the
work it leads to is something a skill governs (for example, investigation
that turns into new tracked work must still go through the issue-filing
skill before code is written). Treat the routing below as authoritative for
THIS prompt.
