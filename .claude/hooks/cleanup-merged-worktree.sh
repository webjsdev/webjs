# Claude Code PostToolUse hook (matcher: Bash).
#
# After a `gh pr merge`, sweep the repo's git worktrees and REMOVE the ones
# whose work has already landed, so a merged branch's worktree does not leak.
# Accumulated stale worktrees (a session that merged but never cleaned up, or
# crashed mid-task) are exactly what this closes: the webjs-start-work skill
# already says "after the PR merges, git worktree remove", but as guidance it
# gets skipped, so this makes the cleanup deterministic.
#
# CONSERVATIVE BY DESIGN. A worktree is removed ONLY when ALL hold:
#   * it is a LINKED worktree, not the primary checkout;
#   * it is NOT the current directory (you cannot remove the one you are in);
#   * its branch is not main/master;
#   * its branch is MERGED (an ancestor of the base ref, OR a merged GitHub PR
#     for that head branch, which is how squash-merges are detected);
#   * its working tree is CLEAN apart from untracked node_modules / .webjs.
# Anything with uncommitted or unpushed-looking work is KEPT and reported, so
# the hook can never destroy in-flight work.
#
# Before removing one, it repoints any `<primary>/node_modules/@webjsdev/*` link
# that targets that worktree back at the primary's own packages (#1442), so a
# removal cannot leave the primary resolving into a directory that is gone.
#
# It never blocks the tool (always exits 0) and reports what it did back to the
# model via hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext. Disable with
# WEBJS_NO_WORKTREE_CLEANUP=1, which disables the repoint along with everything
# else, since it is the same teardown.
#
# Rule: AGENTS.md "One task per git worktree" + the webjs-start-work skill.
