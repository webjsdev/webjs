# PreToolUse hook: BLOCK a `git commit` that changes public-facing
# framework source but stages NO documentation surface. In webjs,
# documentation is part of the definition of done, not an afterthought:
# the docs app PLUS every monorepo markdown surface (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md /
# CONVENTIONS.md, agent-docs/, README, the docs site, the marketing
# website, the scaffold templates' per-agent rule files). The recurring
# failure was updating ONE surface (or none) and shipping the rest stale,
# so the docs drift behind the framework. HTTP-verb server actions (#488)
# shipped with AGENTS.md updated but the docs site untouched.
#
# This is the doc twin of require-tests-with-src.sh: it fires on every
# commit, decides from the STAGED diff (not model judgement), and BLOCKS
# (exit 2) when source is staged with no doc surface in the same commit.
# Earlier this hook only reminded; it now gates, because a reminder was
# routinely missed and docs shipped stale.
#
# What a hook CANNOT do: know WHICH surfaces a change needs (that is the
# webjs-doc-sync skill's job). So it enforces the floor (a public-source
# commit must stage SOME doc surface) and points at the skill for the
# substantive, per-surface sync.
#
# Scope: only fires on `git commit` Bash calls. Inspects the STAGED diff,
# so `git add` choices drive it.
#
# Allowed (exit 0): commits touching no public src; commits that stage a
# doc surface alongside source; and a genuinely internal change (refactor,
# CI, release, perf with no behaviour change) via WEBJS_NO_DOC_GATE=1.
# (`git commit --no-verify` skips git's own hooks, not this one, so the
# message names the env escape hatch.)
#
# Rule: AGENTS.md "Code workflow" item 2 (Documentation) + the
# webjs-doc-sync skill.

BLOCKED: this commit changes framework source but stages no documentation.

Staged source under packages/*/src/** (or cli/lib) with no doc surface in
the same commit. In webjs, documentation is part of the definition of done:
a task is NOT done until every surface its change touches is in sync.

If this changed a PUBLIC or AGENT-FACING surface (an export, a CLI flag, a
package.json webjs.* key, an html hole, a lifecycle hook, a convention, or
the behaviour of an already-documented feature), invoke the webjs-doc-sync
skill, then `git add` EVERY applicable surface and commit again:
  AGENTS.md + agent-docs/*.md            agent reference
  docs/app/docs/<topic>                  the docs site
  README.md                              if a headline capability
  website/                               marketing copy, if headline
  packages/cli/templates/                scaffold per-agent rule files
  CONVENTIONS.md / per-package AGENTS.md if a convention changed
Updating AGENTS.md alone reproduces the #488 gap (docs site left stale).

Genuinely internal change (refactor, CI, release, perf with no behaviour
change) that needs no doc edit? Re-run with WEBJS_NO_DOC_GATE=1.
