description: Use this skill when the user asks to start work on a tracked GitHub issue in the webjsdev/webjs project. Trigger phrases include "work on #112", "start work on issue 113", "tackle #114", "begin issue N", "let's work on the dist issue", "pick up #N", or any natural-language reference to starting an open issue on the webjs project board. The skill creates a feature branch off main, moves the project card to "In progress", and sets up the workspace so subsequent commits and the PR have the right shape.
when_to_use: |
  Examples that should trigger this skill:
    "work on #112"
    "start work on issue 113"
    "tackle the dist issue (#113)"
    "pick up #114"
    "let's start work on the rate-limit issue"
    "begin work on the next webjs todo"
  Do NOT trigger for: opening a PR for already-in-progress work, merging, asking what issues are open, or any non-webjs project.
  ALSO invoke this (right after webjs-file-issue) before writing ANY code for
  new work that has no issue yet, even when the user did not name an issue. The
  standing rule is: no code before a tracked issue AND a branch cut from it.

# Start work on a webjs GitHub issue

The webjsdev/webjs project tracks work on the GitHub Project board at https://github.com/orgs/webjsdev/projects/1. This skill runs the start-of-work lifecycle whenever the user wants to begin a tracked issue.

## Precondition: the work MUST already have a tracked issue

This skill picks up from an EXISTING issue. Before running any step below, confirm the task has one. It often does NOT: a task that arrives from a conversation, a code-review finding, a dogfood observation, or your own idea has no issue yet, and THAT is the gap this guards.

**If there is no tracked issue for this work, STOP. Do not create a branch, do not write code.** First invoke `webjs-file-issue` to file it and capture the new number, THEN run this skill with that number. Starting code on untracked work is a process failure: the PR ships with no `Closes #N`, the work never appears on the board, and the card never moves to Done. This has happened (a whole feature was implemented and merged before any issue existed, then filed retroactively only after the user noticed).

If you are unsure whether an issue already exists, search before filing:

```sh
gh api "search/issues?q=repo:webjsdev/webjs+is:issue+<keywords>&per_page=20" \
  --jq '.items[] | "#\(.number) [\(.state)] \(.title)"'
```

Search the ISSUES over REST rather than dumping the board. It matches bodies as
well as titles, so it is the better duplicate check, and it costs nothing from
the GraphQL budget. See `.claude/gh-budget.md`.

When in doubt, file it. A duplicate is cheap to close; untracked work is the expensive failure. Only once an issue number exists do you continue to Inputs below.

## Inputs

The user's request typically names an issue by number (e.g. `#112`) or by description (e.g. "the dist issue"). Resolve the number first:

- If the user said `#N` explicitly, use N.
- If they described the issue by topic, search the issues over REST and match against titles. If multiple match, ask the user to disambiguate.

  ```sh
  gh api "search/issues?q=repo:webjsdev/webjs+is:issue+is:open+<topic>&per_page=20" \
    --jq '.items[] | "#\(.number) \(.title)"'
  ```

  Do not dump the board for this. Searching issues costs nothing from the GraphQL budget and matches bodies too, so it resolves a vague description better than a title scan would.

## Steps

1. **Verify the issue exists and is open. Assign it to vivek7405 if not already.**

   ```sh
   gh api repos/webjsdev/webjs/issues/<N> \
     --jq '{number,state,title,labels:[.labels[].name],assignees:[.assignees[].login]}'
   ```

   REST rather than `gh issue view`, which goes through GraphQL. See `.claude/gh-budget.md`.

   If `state` is CLOSED, ask the user whether to reopen it or pick a different one. Otherwise note the title for the branch slug, and the labels for the branch prefix. If `assignees` is empty (an issue filed by drive-by contributor), assign to vivek7405:

   ```sh
   gh api -X POST repos/webjsdev/webjs/issues/<N>/assignees -f 'assignees[]=vivek7405'
   ```

2. **Confirm the issue is on the project board, and get its item id.**

   Ask the ISSUE, not the board. This is a single node lookup that also returns the id step 5 needs and the card's current Status, so one call replaces both the membership check here and the id hunt later:

   ```sh
   gh api graphql -f query='query($n:Int!){repository(owner:"webjsdev",name:"webjs"){
     issue(number:$n){projectItems(first:5){nodes{id project{number}
     fieldValueByName(name:"Status"){...on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue{name}}}}}}}' \
     -F n=<N> --jq '.data.repository.issue.projectItems.nodes[] | select(.project.number == 1)'
   ```

   An empty result means the issue is not on the board. Add it with `gh project item-add 1 --owner webjsdev --url https://github.com/webjsdev/webjs/issues/<N>`, then re-run the lookup to get the new item id.

   **Do NOT dump the whole board to answer this.** That query paginates every item (past 500 today) with nested field values, costing several hundred points of the 5000-point hourly GraphQL budget, to find one id this call returns directly. Projects V2 is GraphQL-only, so these points are the ones genuinely worth protecting.

3. **Fetch, and leave the primary checkout alone.** `git fetch origin`. The task's worktree cuts from `origin/main`, so a dirty or mid-something primary checkout neither blocks starting nor gets "fixed"; it is never edited at all (enforced by `.claude/hooks/require-worktree-for-edits.sh`, which blocks tracked-file edits in a primary checkout).

4. **Create the task's WORKTREE and push its branch immediately.** One task, one worktree, ALWAYS; there is no lone-agent plain-branch path, because "no other agent is active" is unverifiable mid-task. Pick the prefix from the issue labels: `enhancement` to `feat/`, `bug` to `fix/`, `documentation` to `docs/`, otherwise `chore/`. Build the slug from the issue title (lowercase, kebab-case, max 30 chars, drop conjunctions). The push happens right away so the work survives any local-machine failure even before the first commit.

   ```sh
   git worktree add -b <prefix>/<slug> ../<repo>-<slug> origin/main
   git -C ../<repo>-<slug> push -u origin <prefix>/<slug>
   ```

   ALL work for the task happens inside that worktree, by absolute path when the session's cwd resets. A fresh worktree has NO `node_modules`; see AGENTS.md for the symlink remedy (#954). Cleanup after merge is automatic (`cleanup-merged-worktree.sh`). After this step, ALSO push after every subsequent commit (`git push` is cheap and is the safety net against losing work). Do not batch multiple commits before pushing.

5. **Move the project card from Todo to In progress.** The item id came from step 2; the other three ids are constants, so source them instead of rediscovering them:

   ```sh
   source .claude/gh-ids.env    # PROJECT_ID, STATUS_FIELD_ID, STATUS_IN_PROGRESS
   ITEM_ID=<the id step 2 returned>
   gh project item-edit --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" --id "$ITEM_ID" \
     --field-id "$STATUS_FIELD_ID" --single-select-option-id "$STATUS_IN_PROGRESS"
   ```

   The project id, the Status field id, and its option ids never change, so re-resolving them cost three GraphQL round trips per run for constants. `.claude/gh-ids.env` carries them, with the refresh command in its header for the rare case the board schema moves.

   If `ITEM_ID` is empty, step 2 did not find the card. Go back and add it rather than passing an empty `--id`, which fails.

6. **Open a DRAFT PR immediately, BEFORE writing any code.** This is the single most important ordering rule and it is NOT optional: the PR is opened at the START of the work, not the end. The whole point of the PR is to be the durable, append-only record of the change AS IT HAPPENS: every per-logical-unit commit lands on it, every design-rationale / decision / follow-up context comment is posted to it the moment that discussion happens, and the owner's review lands on it. NONE of that is possible if the PR does not exist yet, which is exactly the failure a late `gh pr create` causes. So open it now, empty branch and all (the branch was already pushed in step 4).

   Push one trivial initial commit if the branch has no commits yet (GitHub refuses a PR with no diff between head and base); the cleanest is to defer this step to immediately after the FIRST real commit, but never later than that. Open it as a DRAFT so it is clearly not yet ready to merge:

   ```sh
   gh pr create --repo webjsdev/webjs --base main --head <prefix>/<slug> --draft \
     --assignee vivek7405 \
     --title "<conventional-prefix>: <imperative summary>" \
     --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
   # write /tmp/pr-body.md first: "Closes #<N>" plus a one-line summary of the
   # intended change. It is a living body, refined as the work lands.
   ```

   The title MUST carry a conventional-commit prefix from the first moment (feat/fix/perf/breaking appear in the changelog; chore/docs/test/refactor do not), because a single-commit PR squashes on the COMMIT subject and a multi-commit PR on the TITLE. Refine the title/body as the change takes shape; the draft is a living document. Capture the issue URL/number for `Closes #<N>` (already in the body).

   From here on, the PR exists, so: commit per logical unit and push after each (the commits stream onto the PR); post design-rationale / decision / follow-up context comments to the PR as those discussions happen (do not hoard them for the end). The PR is marked **ready for review** (`gh pr ready <N>`) only at the very end, AFTER the Definition of done is satisfied. From there the owner reviews it. Opening late and dumping everything at the end is the anti-pattern this step exists to kill.

7. **Report back briefly.** One short message to the user: issue title + number, new branch name, draft PR URL, "project card moved to In progress". Then continue with the actual work the user asked for.

## Definition of done (MUST be satisfied BEFORE marking the draft PR ready for review)

The PR is already open as a draft (step 6). "Done" here means the gate to flip it from draft to **ready for review** (`gh pr ready <N>`), NOT the gate to create it. Everything below must be addressed before that flip.

**Bun parity is part of the task, not an afterthought.** webjs runs on Node 24+ AND Bun (#508). If the change touches a runtime-sensitive surface (the serializer, the node:http vs `Bun.serve` listener + request path, SSR / action / CSRF dispatch, streams, `node:crypto`, the TS stripper, auth / session / cors), then BEFORE you mark the PR ready you MUST (1) run the Bun matrix and report it green (`node scripts/run-bun-tests.js` plus the touched `test/bun/*.mjs` under `bun`), and (2) add or update a `test/bun/<feature>.mjs` cross-runtime assertion for the surface. This is enforced: `.claude/hooks/require-bun-parity-with-runtime-src.sh` BLOCKS a commit that stages runtime-sensitive source with no `test/bun/**` test (escape hatch `WEBJS_BUN_VERIFIED=1` only when an existing Bun script already covers it AND you ran it). Treat the parity, not just the Node result, as the bar.

Doc drift is the #1 way a framework rots. Documentation MUST stay in sync with code on the same PR that changes the code. Do NOT defer doc work to a follow-up issue, do NOT let the user have to ask. Before marking the draft PR ready for review, walk through every surface below and either update it OR write "N/A because <reason>" in the PR body so the omission is visible.

### Surfaces to consider on EVERY PR

1. **Tests, ALL applicable layers (not just unit).** This is generative, not "write a unit test and move on". The repo has several test layers; for the changed surface, add or update coverage in EVERY layer the change can affect, then RUN that layer. Walk them explicitly:
   - **Unit** (`packages/*/test/**`, `test/**`): pure logic, analysers, helpers. Include counterfactuals (the negative case that proves the check actually fires).

     **Running a counterfactual safely (commit FIRST, revert through git, never sed-toggle source).** A counterfactual proves a test fails when the fix is removed. The safe order is: COMMIT the fix and its test first, THEN temporarily revert ONLY the source guard, run the test (expect red), and restore. Two traps that have bitten this exact flow, both avoidable:
       - **Do NOT `git checkout <file>` to "undo" a counterfactual while the fix is still uncommitted.** `git checkout` restores the file to HEAD, which (pre-commit) has NO fix, so it silently throws the whole fix away, not just the temporary neutering. Commit first; then `git checkout <file>` restores the COMMITTED fix, which is what you want.
       - **Do NOT neuter a guard by `sed`-rewriting the source to a sentinel like `''`.** Shell-quoted escapes land as a literal control byte (a NUL/0x01) inside the file, which renders like a space in an editor but breaks the comparison and makes `grep` treat the file as binary (silent empty matches). Verify any byte-level edit with `od -c` on the changed line and `tr -d '\000' | wc -c` for stray NULs. Prefer the Edit tool (toggle the guard, run, toggle back) or `git stash`/`git stash pop` of the committed source over `sed` for this.
     The clean loop: commit fix+test, run test green, `git stash push -- <source-file>` (or Edit out the guard), run test red, `git stash pop` (or Edit the guard back), run test green again. The test having gone red in the middle is the proof.

     **A counterfactual CLAIM decays.** "Reverting X reds Y" is true of a commit, not a branch: a later commit touching the same mechanism can make it false while every test stays green (a later fix commit once made an older test non-discriminating exactly this way). So date the claim to the commit it was proven at, and when a later commit touches that mechanism, re-run the toggle and restate or correct the claim. This applies to fix commits made in response to review feedback too.
   - **Integration** (server-level through `createRequestHandler`, SSR pipeline, scaffolds): behaviour across modules without a browser.
   - **Browser** (`*/test/**/browser/*.test.js`, run via `npm run test:browser` / `wtr`): anything touching hydration, client render, DOM, slots, the client router, custom-element upgrade.
   - **E2E** (`test/e2e/e2e.test.mjs`, run via `WEBJS_E2E=1`): full-stack behaviour observable only in a real browser against the running blog example, including **network probes** (was a module fetched or not), navigation, and streaming.
   - **Smoke** (`test/examples/*/smoke/*`): the example apps still boot and serve their key routes.
   - **Cross-runtime (Bun)** (`node scripts/run-bun-tests.js`, needs `bun` on PATH; the `test/bun/*.mjs` scripts run under both runtimes): webjs runs on **Node 24+ OR Bun** (#508), so a change to runtime-sensitive code MUST be proven on Bun, not just Node. "Runtime-sensitive" = the serializer (Blob/File/FormData/typed arrays), the server request/listener path (the node:http vs `Bun.serve` shells, SSE, WebSocket upgrade, compression, timeouts), streams + `node:fs` (anything using `Readable.fromWeb` / `pipeline` / `createWriteStream`), `node:crypto`, the TS stripper, `AsyncLocalStorage`, or ANY `node:*` API whose behaviour Bun may implement differently. The Bun matrix (`scripts/run-bun-tests.js`) re-runs the `node:test` suite under `bun test` and FAILS on a genuine divergence; a divergence is a REAL bug to fix in the framework (this session found 5: a FormData fresh-identity serializer crash, a `Readable.fromWeb` `put()` hang, the amaro vs Node TS-strip error code, a JSC vs V8 error-message format, a link-unsafe `node:module` named import), not something to skip. Add a `test/bun/<feature>.mjs` cross-runtime assert script (wired into the CI `bun` job) for any new surface that touches the listener / serializer / streaming path. A test that is legitimately Node-only (asserts a node:http internal, the built-in stripper, `module.registerHooks` seeding, the node `ws`-library subsystem) goes on the runner's documented `DENYLIST` with a reason and a note of where the Bun behaviour IS covered; if a file MIXES runtime-agnostic and Node-only tests, SPLIT the Node-only ones into their own file so the rest still runs on Bun. See the skill's `references/testing.md`.

   The trap: **`npm test` does NOT run the browser, e2e, or Bun layers** (browser needs `wtr`; e2e is gated behind `WEBJS_E2E=1`; the Bun matrix is a separate `node scripts/run-bun-tests.js` and runs only the Node path otherwise). A green `npm test` is necessary but NOT sufficient. If the change can affect client behaviour or the served wire, you MUST run `npm run test:browser` and/or `WEBJS_E2E=1 node --test test/e2e/e2e.test.mjs`; if it touches runtime-sensitive code (above), you MUST run `node scripts/run-bun-tests.js` (with `bun` installed) and the `test/bun/*.mjs` scripts under Bun, then report the result. Reasoning "the unit tests pass" while shipping a change that alters what the browser downloads, OR that diverges on Bun, is the exact failure this rule exists to prevent.

   Acceptance criteria phrased in browser terms ("network probe", "renders without JS", "hydrates", "no console errors") are a hard signal that an e2e or browser test is REQUIRED, not optional. For each layer, either add/update coverage and run it, or write "N/A because <reason>" in the PR body. If a pre-existing test in a layer you ran is already red on `main`, say so explicitly (with proof) rather than letting it look like your regression.
2. **Every markdown file in the repo** that describes the changed surface. The rule is generative, not enumerative. Run `git ls-files '*.md'` and for each path ask: does this file describe behaviour, surface, or invariants this PR changed? If yes, update it on this PR. Common surfaces (non-exhaustive, this list is NOT a substitute for the git query):
   - `AGENTS.md` (framework root + every nested one under `packages/*/`, `docs/`, `website/`, `examples/*/`, `packages/ui/packages/*/`).
   - the skill's `references/*.md` (routing-and-pages, components, data-and-actions, auth-and-sessions, styling, client-router-and-streaming, optimistic-ui, typescript, testing, built-ins, runtime, service-worker, muscle-memory-gotchas), plus repo-root `framework-dev.md`.
   - `packages/*/README.md` (npm-visible for every published package). Update when the public surface, install layout, or expected usage changed.
   - `CHANGELOG.md` (per-package, under `changelog/<pkg>/<version>.md`). Generated automatically by the pre-commit hook on version-bump commits; review and add migration notes for breaking changes. Without a version bump, no changelog entry.
   - `CLAUDE.md` (only if a Claude Code rule is specifically added; framework conventions go in AGENTS.md).
   - `.github/*.md` (issue templates, PR templates, contributing) when a workflow rule shifts.
3. **User-facing docs site** under `website/app/docs/<topic>/page.ts` (these are `.ts` files, not markdown, so they're excluded by the markdown query but they're the canonical user-facing reference). If the change is visible to a user reading the docs site, update the matching topic page. Add a new page if the surface is new and there's no obvious home.
4. **Scaffold templates** under `packages/cli/templates/` and the generators `packages/cli/lib/{create,api-gallery}.js`. Update if the change affects what `webjs create` generates. The scaffold ships a gallery index home + layout + db wiring, a densely-commented feature gallery (the repo-root `gallery/**` app, demos under `app/features/` plus `app/examples/todo`, bundled into the CLI at prepack) and the api showcase (`api-gallery.js`), plus one cross-agent skill at `.agents/skills/webjs/` (SKILL.md + references) that the agent grows in place; there are no per-agent rule files. A feature change that agents should know about lands in the skill; a generated-code change lands in the generators, verified with `generate + boot + webjs check`.
5. **The MCP server** (the standalone `@webjsdev/mcp` package, `packages/mcp/src/{mcp,mcp-docs,mcp-source}.js`, extracted from the CLI in #415; `webjs mcp` and `npx @webjsdev/mcp` both run it). The MCP is how AI agents learn and introspect webjs, so it must stay in lockstep with the surfaces it exposes. Update it whenever the change touches what it serves:
   - **Introspection tools** (`list_routes` / `list_actions` / `list_components` / `list_elision` / `check`): if you change the route table shape, the action/RPC-hash scheme, component registration, or a `webjs check` rule, update the matching tool projection so the MCP reports reality.
   - **Knowledge layer** (resources + `init` + `docs` + prompts): the resources are the skill at `.agents/skills/webjs/` (SKILL.md + references/) + `AGENTS.md`, so a docs change is picked up automatically (it is bundled at `prepack`). But if you add or rename a skill reference file, ADD A NEW INVARIANT, change the execution model, or add an authoring concept an agent should know, also: (a) confirm the `init` primer still pulls the right `AGENTS.md` sections (it sources the Execution-model + Invariants headings, so a heading rename breaks it), and (b) add a guided-workflow PROMPT for any new common recipe (a new page/route/action/component-shaped task). New recipes without a prompt are a silent gap.
   - **Heuristic:** if your change would make an agent reading only the old MCP output write WRONG webjs code, the MCP is part of your change. Update it on this PR, with a test in `packages/mcp/test/*.test.mjs`, or write "N/A because <reason>" in the PR body.
6. **The editor plugins** (epic #381, now under `packages/editors/` after the #402 reorg; the suite overview that maps all three + the full dev/publish flow is `packages/editors/AGENTS.md`): the all-in-one `webjs` VS Code extension (`packages/editors/vscode`), `webjs.nvim` (`packages/editors/nvim`), and the shared language service `@webjsdev/intellisense` (`packages/editors/intellisense`, renamed from `@webjsdev/ts-plugin` in #416/#420) that BOTH editor plugins bundle. Note `webjs.nvim` is developed here but installed by users from a SEPARATE repo `webjsdev/webjs.nvim` (a git-subtree split of `packages/editors/nvim`), so nvim changes are not live until that split is re-pushed on release (`packages/editors/nvim/PUBLISHING.md`). They are how a developer's editor understands webjs, so they must stay in lockstep with the surfaces they expose. Update them whenever the change touches what they project. Do this automatically when the task demands it; never make the user ask:
   - **The shared language service** (`packages/editors/intellisense/src`): any change to its behaviour (the template parser, tag/attr resolution, completions, diagnostics, hover) flows to EVERY consumer. **This is the single most-missed step, and it reds CI:** both editor plugins **bundle** a copy. The VS Code extension esbuilds it at vsix package time (`packages/editors/vscode/scripts/build.mjs`, picked up automatically), but webjs.nvim ships a COMMITTED verbatim copy that a drift test enforces. So after ANY edit under `packages/editors/intellisense/src/` (even one line), AND after any edit to that package's `package.json` INCLUDING a release version bump, you MUST, before pushing, run `node packages/editors/nvim/scripts/vendor-intellisense.mjs` then `git add -f packages/editors/nvim/vendor` (the copy is under a gitignored `node_modules/`), or the `packages/editors/nvim/test/vendor-sync.test.mjs` drift guard FAILS the "Unit + integration" CI job ("vendored intellisense src is byte-identical ..."). The manifest is compared in full, version included, so a release that bumps intellisense must re-vendor on the release branch (#1117 shipped a plugin misreporting its own language-service version because nothing enforced that). Confirm with `node --test packages/editors/nvim/test/vendor-sync.test.mjs`. The coupling is bidirectional: the nvim copy under `packages/editors/nvim/vendor/node_modules/@webjsdev/intellisense/` is GENERATED, so NEVER hand-edit it when working in the nvim package (edit `intellisense/src` + re-vendor instead); the same drift guard reds CI either way. The scaffold ALSO pins `@webjsdev/intellisense` in app node_modules + tsconfig (intelligence with no editor plugin; tsserver dedupes when both load), so an intellisense version bump is a real publish. (Full flow also in `packages/editors/intellisense/AGENTS.md`.)
   - **Template grammars / injection queries** (`packages/editors/vscode/syntaxes/webjs-{html,css,svg}.json` AND `packages/editors/nvim/queries/{typescript,javascript}/injections.scm`): if you add, rename, or change the recognised tags (`html`/`css`/`svg`) or how `${...}` holes are scoped, update BOTH the VS Code TextMate grammars and the Neovim treesitter queries, plus their tests (`packages/editors/vscode/test/extension.test.mjs` begin-patterns, `packages/editors/nvim/test/selftest.lua` injection assertions).
   - **Snippets + commands** (`packages/editors/vscode/snippets/webjs.json`, `src/extension.js`; webjs.nvim `lua/webjs/` commands): if you add or rename a common recipe or a surfaced command, add/adjust the matching snippet/command (the vscode test cross-checks contributed commands against `registerCommand`).
   - **Publishing on a release.** The VS Code extension publishes to the VS Marketplace + Open VSX (`packages/editors/vscode/PUBLISHING.md`); webjs.nvim is a git subtree split mirrored to `webjsdev/webjs.nvim` (re-run the split + force-push after a change; `packages/editors/nvim/PUBLISHING.md`). Bump `packages/editors/vscode/package.json` `version` when its bundle changes.
   - **Heuristic:** if your change would make an editor highlight wrong, resolve the wrong definition, offer a stale snippet/command, or ship a drifted bundle, the editor plugins are part of your change. Update them on the same PR (with the matching test), re-vendor the nvim copy, or write "N/A because <reason>" in the PR body.
7. **Marketing copy** at `website/app/page.ts`. Update if the change touches positioning or any landing-page claim ("no-build", "AI-first", "web components first", etc.).
8. **Dogfood apps must still build and boot. MANDATORY GATE, run it automatically, never wait to be asked.** The framework ships two in-repo apps that consume it: `examples/blog` (the demo) and `website` (the marketing pages plus /docs and /ui). A framework change that compiles is NOT done until both still serve. This is a recurring miss: running only the blog e2e and stopping is the exact failure this gate exists to prevent. For ANY change to `packages/core`, `packages/server`, `packages/cli`, the dist build, the importmap, or anything that alters what the browser fetches, you MUST run the full two-app check below before marking the draft PR ready for review and report its result in the PR body. The user should never have to ask "did you check the apps?".

   **The check (copy-paste, runs in seconds):**
   - `examples/blog`: covered by the e2e suite. Run `WEBJS_E2E=1 node --test test/e2e/e2e.test.mjs` (it exercises the blog in a real browser; if `dist/` is built it runs in dist mode, so it covers the production wire too).
   - `website`: boot it through `createRequestHandler` in PROD mode and GET a real route, asserting status < 400. It is the app that serves every HTML surface the project has, the marketing pages plus the documentation at `/docs` (#1098) and the component gallery at `/ui` (#1099), so its routes are where a break shows up. Write this harness to a file INSIDE the repo (bare `@webjsdev/*` specifiers only resolve from the repo's `node_modules`, NOT from `/tmp`), run it, delete it:

     ```js
     // ./.boot-check.mjs  (write at repo root, run `node ./.boot-check.mjs`, then rm)
     import { createRequestHandler } from '@webjsdev/server';
     import { resolve } from 'node:path';
     const apps = [
       // /ui/button is the heaviest page: it pulls the mirrored kit component
       // sources, the exact import class a broken preload shows up in.
       { name: 'website', dir: 'website', routes: ['/', '/docs/<a-page-you-touched>', '/ui', '/ui/button'] },
     ];
     let fail = false;
     for (const app of apps) {
       try {
         const h = await createRequestHandler({ appDir: resolve(app.dir), dev: false });
         if (h.warmup) await h.warmup();
         for (const r of app.routes) {
           const resp = await h.handle(new Request('http://localhost' + r));
           const html = resp.status < 400 ? await resp.text() : '';
           // Every modulepreload hint must resolve: a preload pointing at a
           // 404 is a real bug (the preload set must be a subset of the
           // servable set). Probe each same-origin href through the SAME
           // in-process handler (method-agnostic, so no GET-vs-HEAD trap).
           const preloads = [...html.matchAll(/<link[^>]+rel=["']modulepreload["'][^>]*href=["']([^"']+)["']/g)].map((m) => m[1]).filter((h) => h.startsWith('/'));
           const broken = [];
           for (const p of preloads) { const pr = await h.handle(new Request('http://localhost' + p)); if (pr.status >= 400) broken.push(`${p}->${pr.status}`); }
           const ok = resp.status < 400 && broken.length === 0;
           console.log(`${ok ? 'OK  ' : 'FAIL'} ${app.name} ${r} -> ${resp.status}, preloads=${preloads.length}, broken=[${broken.join(', ')}]`);
           if (!ok) fail = true;
         }
       } catch (e) { console.log(`FAIL ${app.name} boot threw: ${String(e.message).split('\n')[0]}`); fail = true; }
     }
     process.exit(fail ? 1 : 0);
     ```

     Add `GET` routes for any page you edited (a 307/308 redirect is a pass; it has no body to inspect). If a change is browser-wire-affecting (dist build, importmap, core exports), also assert the served `<script type="importmap">` reflects the change (e.g. grep the response HTML for the expected URLs), since a 200 alone does not prove the right modules were wired. The harness above also asserts no `modulepreload` hint 404s, which is how the #158 / #159 class of bug (a preload pointing at a server-only or phantom file the auth gate refuses to serve) gets caught automatically. **Auditing a LIVE deployed app instead of an in-process handler? Probe each preload URL with GET, never HEAD: the dev/prod server only serves source files on GET, so a HEAD probe 404s every source URL and makes a healthy app look completely broken.**
   - The scaffold: `webjs create` generates an app whose `package.json` pins `@webjsdev/*: 'latest'` (see `packages/cli/lib/create.js`). If the change alters generated code, agent-config files, or expected scaffold behaviour, update `packages/cli/templates/` AND the generators in `packages/cli/lib/`, then confirm a freshly scaffolded app passes `webjs check` and `webjs test` (the `test/scaffolds/` suite covers this; run it). Even when you believe no scaffold change is needed, grep `packages/cli/templates/` for anything the change renamed or removed (e.g. a dropped dist filename, a changed import path) so a stale template reference does not ship into every new app.

   Report the dogfood result in the PR body (e.g. "Dogfood: blog e2e 50/50; website boots 200 on /, /docs/*, /ui, /ui/button in dist mode with no broken preloads; scaffold N/A"). "All apps verified" with no evidence is not acceptable.
9. **Version bumps must keep the workspace consistent.** When you bump a `packages/<pkg>/package.json` `version` (which the pre-commit hook turns into a changelog):
   - Every in-repo dependent that pins that package (grep `"@webjsdev/<pkg>"` across all `package.json` files) must have its range updated so the new version still satisfies it. A minor bump (`0.7.x` -> `0.8.0`) falls outside a `^0.7.0` range, so npm stops linking the local workspace and pulls the published copy instead.
   - Regenerate `package-lock.json` (`npm install --package-lock-only`) and commit it. `npm ci` (which CI runs) fails on any lockfile desync, so an unsynced lock is a guaranteed red CI.
   - Prefer a patch bump for a feature/fix when the repo keeps a package in a single minor line (check whether dependents pin `^0.x.0`); reach for a minor bump only when you are also ready to bump every dependent range.
10. **PR body** itself documents the change for reviewers. Include `Closes #<N>`, a short summary, and a test plan checklist.

### How to use the checklist

For each item above, explicitly answer one of:
- **Updated**, with the file path in the commit/PR body.
- **N/A because**, with a one-sentence reason.

The "every markdown file" rule is generative because new markdown files appear over a project's lifetime. A closed enumeration silently excludes them; the git query is the source of truth.

If you find yourself writing "N/A" for every item except tests, that is a smell. Most user-visible code changes touch at least one markdown file and the relevant `website/app/docs/<topic>/page.ts` page.

### Concrete examples from recent PRs

- PR #110 (`fs.watch` + Web Crypto): updated `AGENTS.md` (no-build claim wording), `packages/server/AGENTS.md` (file watcher mention), `website/app/docs/{configuration,deployment,no-build}/page.ts` (chokidar → fs.watch). Tests covered the watcher, the boundary, and the migration.
- PR #111 (module-graph asset gate): updated `AGENTS.md` (new invariant about the gate), `packages/server/AGENTS.md` (gate + guardrail invariants), `website/app/docs/no-build/page.ts` (new "authorisation gate" subsection). Tests covered the gate end-to-end.
- PR #117 (core dist bundles): updated `website/app/docs/no-build/page.ts` (the @webjsdev/core exception note), `packages/core/README.md` (tarball layout), `packages/core/AGENTS.md` (invariant 1 rewording), `packages/server/AGENTS.md` (importmap.js module-map entry).

If a PR ships without ANY of those touches and the change is user-visible, the PR is incomplete; do not mark it ready for review (leave it draft until the surfaces are addressed).

## Anatomy of a complete PR: three things, always

A finished PR is not just a diff. It carries three artifacts, and the PR is considered incomplete until all three exist. Treat this as the standing definition of a complete PR, applied automatically on every one:

1. **A meaningful, conventional-commit-prefixed title.** The title MUST start with a conventional-commit type so the changelog is generated automatically: `feat:` for a new user-facing capability, `fix:` for a bug fix, `perf:` for a performance improvement, `breaking:` (or a `!` like `feat!:`) for a breaking change, and `chore:` / `docs:` / `test:` / `refactor:` for changes that should NOT appear in the changelog. After the prefix, be imperative, specific, what-and-why, under ~72 chars total. Example: `fix: shared rich values round-trip through the RPC serializer`, not `Fix serializer` or the issue number alone.
   **Why this matters (do not skip it):** PRs are squash-merged, so the PR TITLE becomes the squash commit subject on `main`, and `scripts/backfill-changelog.js` (run by the pre-commit hook on a version bump) extracts changelog entries by matching that subject against `^(feat|fix|breaking|perf)(scope)?!?:` and reads the commit BODY (the PR description) for the entry text. A non-prefixed title (e.g. `De-flake the prefetch e2e...`) produces ZERO changelog entries, which forces a hand-written changelog at release time, which is wrong. NEVER hand-write `changelog/<pkg>/<version>.md`: fix the PR title/body instead so the automation produces it. If you ever find yourself about to hand-write a changelog, stop and correct the merged PR titles (or the release's source commits) so they are conventional-commit prefixed.
2. **A meaningful body.** `Closes #<N>` near the top, a summary, what changed and why, the deliberately-excluded decisions, a test plan, and the docs surfaces touched (per the Definition of done above). This is the architectural narrative of the change. Because the squash commit body IS this PR description, write the first paragraph so it reads as the changelog entry text (the generator uses it), then continue with the rest.
3. **Context comments.** The reasoning from the working conversation that the diff and body do not capture, posted on the PR as the discussion happens (see "Capture significant design discussion as PR comments" below). The PR is the durable memory; the chat transcript is not.

All three are written in the owner's voice (first person, plain, no AI/agent framing) and free of AGENTS.md invariant 11 banned glyphs. The no-machinery-tells rule binds the context comments; the PR BODY is the one place machinery evidence is REQUIRED content (the test plan and the dogfood results the Definition of done demands), so reporting it there is not a tell. The sections below specify the mechanics for item 3.

**Header every standalone comment with a short, meaningful bold heading** so a future reader (human or AI) knows what the comment is and what it is about before reading it. Put the heading on its own first line as bold markdown, blank line, then the body. Write the heading to fit THIS comment, do not pick from a fixed list. A good heading names the kind of comment and its topic, e.g. `**Design rationale: why analysis moved off boot, and what it costs**`, `**Decision: kept the derived gate over a declared allowlist**`, `**Follow-up: aliased-expose 404 filed as #N**`. A bare category word like `Context` or `Review` is the floor, not the goal; prefer a heading that also says the subject, so a reader scanning the PR's comment list can tell the boot-rationale note from the elision note without opening either. **Threaded replies inside the owner's review comments do NOT need a heading** because the thread already classifies them. Keep those terse. The heading rule is for standalone, top-level comments (the PR body in item 2 is exempt, since it has its own `## Summary` structure).

## Review: the owner reviews every PR

There is NO automated pre-merge review cycle in this workflow. Do not spawn reviewer subagents, do not run multi-round self-review loops, and do not post self-authored review objects to the PR. The review belongs to the owner (vivek7405), who reviews every PR themselves, inline or with an agent of their own choosing, once it is flipped to ready. Your job ends at handing them a reviewable PR and then acting on what their review finds.

Before flipping to ready, run everything the Definition of done demands: the full suites for every layer the change touches (full Node, browser, e2e, the Bun matrix, the two-app dogfood boot check). Launch them as parallel background tasks in one batch and collect EVERY result before reporting, because a task you forget to collect is a silently skipped layer. Then `gh pr ready <N>` and report back that the PR awaits the owner's review. Never report the PR ready with failing or unrun suites.

**If the owner explicitly asks you to review a PR, do it yourself, inline in this session, per the `pr-review` skill** (`.claude/skills/pr-review`, exposed cross-agent at `.agents/skills/pr-review`): one read over the whole diff, posted to the PR through the GitHub review API as one review object, a summary plus line-anchored comments with suggestion blocks. The reviewer ONLY reviews. It never fixes the findings, never resolves threads, never waits on or reports CI, and is never delegated to a subagent or expanded into rounds. The owner decides what gets fixed, and fixing is separate branch work on a separate ask.

### Acting on the owner's review comments

When the owner leaves review comments on the PR, work through each one following GitHub's real flow (fix, reply in the thread, resolve):

1. **Fix it** on the branch (commit + push), or make the case in the thread for leaving it as is and let the owner decide.
2. **Reply in the comment's thread** with the resolution:
   ```sh
   gh api -X POST repos/webjsdev/webjs/pulls/<N>/comments/<comment_id>/replies \
     --input reply.json   # reply.json: { "body": "Fixed in [`<sha>`](https://github.com/webjsdev/webjs/commit/<sha>)." }
   ```
3. **Resolve the thread** once its finding is fixed. Leave a debated or won't-fix thread OPEN for the owner to resolve, since the concern is theirs. Threads resolve ONLY via GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` (REST cannot do it), one of the two sanctioned GraphQL uses in `.claude/gh-budget.md`:
   ```sh
   # list unresolved review-thread node IDs
   gh api graphql -f query='query{repository(owner:"webjsdev",name:"webjs"){pullRequest(number:<N>){reviewThreads(first:50){nodes{id isResolved}}}}}' \
     --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved==false) | .id'
   # resolve one
   gh api graphql -f query='mutation($t:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$t}){thread{isResolved}}}' -f t=<threadId>
   ```

**Voice: write every PR comment and reply as the repo owner (vivek7405) would write it.** First person, plain, the way a person talks about their own code. No AI/agent framing, no machinery tells (CI status, test counts, meta-scaffolding). Reference commits as clickable markdown links, never bare SHAs in code spans, because GitHub does not auto-link a SHA inside a backtick span. Write [`5fd02dc`](https://github.com/webjsdev/webjs/commit/5fd02dc). Banned prose glyphs (AGENTS.md invariant 11) apply to every comment and reply.

### Capture significant design discussion as PR comments (standing, automatic)

Beyond review findings, proactively record the *reasoning* behind a PR as comments on it, without being asked. The PR is the durable memory a future reader (an AI agent picking the work back up, or the owner months later) consults to understand WHY the code is the way it is. The git diff shows WHAT changed; the conversation that produced it (tradeoffs weighed, alternatives rejected, constraints discovered, "we chose X over Y because Z") is lost unless it is written onto the PR. The chat transcript is not durable PR context; the PR comment is.

**Trigger (automatic, not on request):** whenever a conversation about an open PR produces a non-obvious design decision, a rejected alternative, a tradeoff accepted with eyes open, or context the diff alone does not explain, post it as a PR comment AS THE DISCUSSION HAPPENS. Use `gh pr comment <N> --body-file /tmp/pr-comment.md` for cross-cutting narrative, or an inline `file:line` comment when it pertains to specific code. Same voice as review comments: first person, plain, owner's voice, no AI/agent framing, no machinery tells, no banned glyphs.

**This runs continuously across the PR's whole life, not once.** Because the PR opens as a draft at the START (step 6), there is a place to post from the first commit onward, so keep adding context throughout: when a mid-work investigation changes the approach, when the owner's review finding is resolved a particular way, when an edge case is discovered, when something is deliberately deferred. The acceptance test is concrete: a future AI agent (or the owner) who opens ONLY this PR, with zero access to this chat, should find every non-obvious "why" already written on it. If reconstructing the reasoning would require the chat transcript, a context comment is missing. Do not save it all for a single end-of-work dump; that recreates the exact gap the early-draft-PR rule exists to close.

**What's worth capturing (judgement, not a checklist):** why an approach won over a credible alternative; an experiment tried and reverted, with the reason; a tradeoff accepted knowingly (a cold-start cost, a known-small race window left in, a documented edge case); a constraint or invariant discovered mid-work; anything you would want explained if you returned to the PR with no memory of the conversation. Skip the trivial: routine fixes, mechanical edits, anything the diff already makes obvious. The bar is "would a future agent be missing important context without this", not "log everything". When the PR body already covers a decision, a short comment is fine or skip it; do not duplicate the whole body into a comment.

**A PR carries exactly two kinds of content: the code change and its review.** Everything on it (body, commits, context comments, review replies) must be meaningful data about one or the other. Session and harness machinery is NOT PR content and must never be posted there. Concretely, keep OFF the PR: a subagent that could not be spawned or died, a tool that errored or was declined, a retry, an interruption, how many turns something took, and above all your own process mistakes in running the PR (a stale body you then fixed, a mirror you forgot to sync, a mis-posted comment). Those are conversation, not record. The test: would this still matter to someone reading the PR in a year who has no idea which agent or session produced it? A design decision passes. A rejected alternative passes. A review finding passes. "A subagent spawn was declined and I retried" does not, and neither does "I got this wrong earlier in the PR and then corrected it", which reads as noise around a diff that already shows the correction. Fix the mistake and move on; do not narrate it onto the PR.

### Merge is gated on green CI, enforced at the branch level, not by trust

A PR must not merge until CI is green on its pushed head. Today `main` requires the six `ci.yml` Actions job names plus one approving review from a CODEOWNER (`.github/CODEOWNERS` names @vivek7405 for every path, so that means the maintainer). The same list runs locally: `npm run ci` runs the root `webjs.ci` list (everything the GitHub workflow runs, in `Gate` slots) before you push, and `npm run ci -- --signoff` additionally has `gh signoff` post a green `signoff` commit status on the pushed head once every step passes (#1474). That status is not required by the protection yet; `scripts/protect-main.sh` is the switch (plain adds `signoff` to the required set, `--local-only` drops the Actions names), and only the maintainer runs it. Run the list from a REAL install, not a linked worktree (bare `@webjsdev/*` specifiers resolve into the primary there, so the run is partly vacuous). If `gh api repos/webjsdev/webjs/branches/main/protection` shows `required_status_checks: null`, tell the maintainer rather than restoring it yourself. Do not work around a red step. Fix whatever is red and re-run the list.

The gate is read ONCE, at merge, never in a mid-work sleep loop: `gh pr checks` in full rather than trusting the merge button, because `ci.yml` defines roughly twice as many jobs as `main` requires; `gh signoff status` (or `gh api repos/webjsdev/webjs/commits/<sha>/status`) reads the signoff once it is part of the required set.

**NEVER use `gh pr merge --admin` to bypass a FAILING check.** `--admin` skips ALL branch-protection gates, not only the review requirement, so a red check merges silently and lands broken code on `main`. This has happened (a Unit-test failure was admin-merged, breaking `main`). It is acceptable ONLY to bypass a required-review gate on a PR whose CI is confirmed all-green, so re-run `gh pr checks <N>` first and confirm EVERY check reads `pass` (a `BLOCKED` state can mean review-required OR a failing check, so never assume which).

## After a merge: decide on a version bump, automatically

After ANY PR that lands a user-facing change (a `feat` / `fix` / `perf` / `breaking` to a published package: `core`, `server`, `cli`, `ui`, `intellisense`, `mcp`; `intellisense` lives at `packages/editors/intellisense`, the rest at `packages/<pkg>`) merges into `main`, assess whether a release bump is owed and open a release PR WITHOUT being asked. The user should not have to ask "do we need to bump versions?". Docs-only / chore / scaffold-doc changes do NOT bump on their own; they ride to the next functional bump.

**Decide per package, across ALL of them, not just the ones this PR touched.** Release debt accumulates: a package can carry unreleased `feat`/`fix` commits from earlier PRs that were never released. For EACH published package, compare its shipped binary/surface against its latest `changelog/<pkg>/<version>.md`:

```sh
# What is published vs what the changelog covers, per package:
for p in core server cli ui mcp editors/intellisense; do
  name=$(basename "$p")
  echo "$name: pkg=$(node -p "require('./packages/$p/package.json').version") latest-changelog=$(ls changelog/$name 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)"
done
# For each package, are there feat/fix/perf/breaking commits touching its tree since the last release?
git log --oneline <last-release-sha>..main -- packages/<pkg>/
```

If a package has qualifying commits since its last `changelog/<pkg>/<version>.md` that the changelog does not cover, it is owed a bump, EVEN IF the current PR did not touch it. (Real miss: a release PR for core+server shipped while `cli` had an unreleased `vendor --from`/`audit`/`outdated` surface from an earlier PR that no cli changelog covered. Surface every such debt to the user; do not silently leave it.)

**Mechanics of the release PR** (also see Definition-of-done item 9):
1. Branch `chore/release-<pkg>-<version>[-<pkg>-<version>]`.
2. Bump `version` in each `packages/<pkg>/package.json` (edit ONLY the version line; do not reformat the file). Level: **patch** for a `fix`/`feat`/`perf` while the package stays in one minor line (dependents pin `^0.x.0`); **minor** only when you are also ready to widen every dependent's caret range; **major/breaking** for an actual breaking change. **If the bump includes `@webjsdev/intellisense`, re-vendor on this branch** (`node packages/editors/nvim/scripts/vendor-intellisense.mjs` then `git add -f packages/editors/nvim/vendor`), because webjs.nvim ships a committed copy of that manifest and the drift guard compares it in full, version included. Skipping it reds CI, and skipping it silently is how the plugin once shipped misreporting its own language-service version (#1117).
3. Dependent ranges: `grep -rn '"@webjsdev/<pkg>"' --include=package.json . | grep -v node_modules`. A patch stays within the existing caret, so no edits; a minor needs every dependent range widened.
4. `npm install --package-lock-only` and stage `package-lock.json` (a desync reds CI's `npm ci`).
5. Changelog: the pre-commit hook runs `scripts/backfill-changelog.js`, which parses `^(feat|fix|perf|breaking):` from commit subjects in the package's tree. **Squash-merge subjects are PR titles with no conventional prefix, so the generator finds nothing and the hook fails.** Hand-write `changelog/<pkg>/<version>.md` (match an existing file's frontmatter: `package`, `version`, `date`, `commit_count`; sections ordered Breaking, Features, Performance, Fixes; entries link the PR and the squash commit) and stage it; then the commit passes.
6. Open the release PR. Note in the body that merging it adds the `changelog/**.md` files to `main`, which triggers `release.yml` to `npm publish` and cut GitHub Releases (idempotent).
7. Flip it ready for the owner's review like any other PR (a release publishes to npm, so a wrong bump level, missed package, or inaccurate changelog is worth their eyes). Merge is still user-gated.

### Then: make sure the deployed Railway services actually picked it up

A merge updates `main` and npm, but the two in-repo apps deployed to Railway (`examples/blog`, `website`) keep serving the OLD code until they redeploy. After merging a change that affects what those services serve (framework code in `core`/`server`, or an app's own files), verify each service is now running the new `main`, automatically, without being asked. A user-visible fix is not actually shipped until the running service has it.

**Check (needs `railway login`; the Railway MCP):** for each service, `mcp__railway__list_deployments` and compare the latest SUCCESSFUL deployment's commit hash to `git rev-parse origin/main`. A service whose running commit is an ancestor of (behind) `main` is stale. If `mcp__railway__whoami` returns "Not authenticated", say so and ask the user to run `! railway login`; do not guess.

**If a service is stale, trigger a redeploy.** Two mechanisms, in order of preference:
1. If the Railway MCP is authenticated, `mcp__railway__deploy` the stale service directly. No commit, cleanest.
2. Otherwise, the user has authorized a **zero-diff empty commit to `main`** as a deploy trigger: `git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger Railway redeploy (<reason>)" && git push origin main`. THIS IS THE ONE SANCTIONED DIRECT PUSH TO `main` (everything else goes through a PR). It is explicitly NOT a code change and bypasses no review, because there is nothing to review; its sole purpose is to give Railway's auto-deploy a new commit to deploy.

**Nuance, do not over-fire the empty commit.** Railway services connected to a GitHub branch auto-deploy on every push BY DEFAULT, so a real merge already triggered the redeploy and an empty commit right after would be redundant; only the version-bump/merge commit itself is needed. The empty commit is the fix for the narrower case where a service has Railway **watch-paths** configured (it only redeploys when files under its own path change), so a framework-only change (e.g. `packages/core`) did not trigger the app service. A no-diff empty commit also will NOT match a restrictive watch-path, so if the check shows a watch-path-filtered service still stale, prefer mechanism 1 (MCP `deploy`) or tell the user the service needs a manual redeploy / a watch-path that includes the framework packages. So: check first, redeploy ONLY the services the check proves are behind, and report which services you redeployed and how.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Opens the PR as a DRAFT at the START (step 6), not at the end. It is NOT created late once all the work is done. At draft-create time:
  - The body MUST include `Closes #<N>` near the top so merging auto-closes the issue and the project card auto-moves to Done. If the work turns out to only partially address the issue, use a plain `#N` reference, not `Closes`.
  - The PR MUST be assigned to vivek7405 (`gh pr create ... --assignee vivek7405`). Matches the project's per-issue-owner convention.
  - It stays a draft until the Definition of done is satisfied, then `gh pr ready <N>` flips it to ready for the owner's review.
- Does not make commits FOR you. Subsequent work follows the standard webjs git workflow (commit per logical unit, push after each, run tests before committing); those commits stream onto the already-open PR.
- Does not merge. Merging is always user-approved per the project's git rules.

## Failure handling

- If the TASK worktree's `git status` is dirty at start (a prior session died mid-work in it): stop and ask the user to commit, stash, or abandon that work. Never silently lose changes. A dirty PRIMARY checkout is not a blocker and not yours to fix; the worktree cuts from `origin/main` regardless.
- If the issue is already in `In progress` (someone else's work, or a prior branch left open): report this and ask the user whether to continue on the existing branch, branch off a fresh main, or pick a different issue.
- If the TASK worktree regressed mid-loop (its HEAD detached or off the feature branch, work seemingly "gone"): a subagent mutated shared git state. In the PRIMARY, HEAD on `main` is the healthy state, not a regression. Do NOT panic or redo work. The local feature-branch ref and `origin/<branch>` still point at the latest commit (every logical unit was pushed). Recover with `git -C <task-worktree> checkout <feature-branch>` (anchored: run bare from the primary it would succeed and park the PRIMARY on the feature branch, since a detached worktree no longer holds it); confirm with `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` and `git status` clean. The PR on GitHub was never affected (anything reading the PR from GitHub still saw correct content), so no re-push or force-push is needed.
- If the `gh project item-edit` call fails (auth scope, missing field): report the failure clearly and offer to do the move manually via the web UI. The branch creation still stands.
