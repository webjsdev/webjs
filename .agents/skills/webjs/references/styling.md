# Styling

## What This Covers

- Tailwind-first: the strong default for pages AND light-DOM components, and the Lit reflex it counters
- The light-DOM tag-prefix invariant when raw CSS is unavoidable
- Extracting a repeated Tailwind bundle into a `lib/utils/ui.ts` `html` fragment (not `@apply`)
- Design tokens: `:root` / `@theme` in the root layout
- Light-DOM host `display: block` behaviour (and shadow hosts via `:host`)
- When to use `static styles` (shadow DOM)
- Accessible native controls (label association, `aria-pressed`, `aria-label`)
- `position: fixed`, not `sticky`, for a pinned header (the iOS WebKit flicker)
- Even-grid / no-reflow layout tips

Read this when a task touches a class list, a `<style>`, a design token, a pinned header, or a grid/board/card layout. Sibling ref: `components.md` (light vs shadow DOM, `static styles`, host behaviour in depth).

## Tailwind-first is the strong default

Use Tailwind utilities for pages AND light-DOM components (the default DOM mode). Layout, spacing, color (via `@theme` tokens), typography, borders, radius, shadows, and interaction states (hover/focus/active/disabled, dark mode) are all utility-expressible. Light DOM does not scope styles, so a utility class on a light-DOM element resolves against the global stylesheet exactly as it does on a page. That is why utilities are the right tool there, not an exception.

### The Lit muscle-memory trap

In Lit a component owns a shadow root and scopes its CSS with `static styles = css\`\``, so the reflex is to author scoped CSS or an inline `<style>` with semantic class names (`.hero`, `.card`, `.btn`) per component. In WebJs the default is light DOM, which does NOT scope. A `css` block does nothing without `static shadow = true` (the framework warns at runtime), and an inline `<style>` with bare semantic class names leaks those names into the global namespace. Reach for Tailwind utilities instead. When the same bundle repeats, extract a `lib/utils/ui.ts` helper returning an `html` fragment (below), NOT a CSS class.

### The custom-CSS allowlist

Reserve raw CSS for what utilities genuinely cannot express. This is the exhaustive list, anything outside it should be a utility or a `lib/utils/ui.ts` helper:

- design-token `:root` + `@theme` definitions (palette, fonts, fluid type scale, motion durations, declared once in the root layout),
- `@property` animated custom properties paired with `@keyframes`,
- `::-webkit-scrollbar` and `scrollbar-color` (no utility surface),
- `prefers-reduced-motion` blocks,
- complex `color-mix()` or gradient effects a utility cannot spell.

When custom CSS IS unavoidable inside a light-DOM component, the tag-prefix invariant holds (every class selector is prefixed with the component tag). Shadow-DOM components (`static shadow = true`) legitimately author `static styles = css\`\``, the right home for scoped CSS. The Tailwind-first steer is about the LIGHT-DOM default, not shadow DOM.

## DRY via a JS helper, not `@apply`

When the same Tailwind bundle repeats across 2+ places, extract it into a helper in `lib/utils/ui.ts` that returns an `html` fragment (SSR-time, no client runtime, output identical to inline classes):

```ts
import { html } from '@webjsdev/core';

/** `● label` kicker: small caps, accent colour, above headings. */
export function rubric(label: string, mb: 'sm' | 'md' = 'md') {
  const mbCls = mb === 'sm' ? 'mb-3' : 'mb-4';
  return html`
    <span class="block font-mono text-[11px] leading-none font-semibold tracking-[0.2em] uppercase text-primary ${mbCls}">● ${label}</span>
  `;
}
```

```ts
// app/blog/[slug]/page.ts
import { rubric } from '#lib/utils/ui.ts';

export default function Post({ params }) {
  return html`${rubric('post')}<h1 class="font-serif ...">${title}</h1>`;
}
```

| Repeats | Action |
|---|---|
| Once | Inline the classes. |
| 2 to 3 times, identical | Extract to `lib/utils/ui.ts`. |
| Varies by 1 to 2 props | Extract with a small parameter (`mb: 'sm' \| 'md'`). |
| Radically different per call site | Keep inline, do not force-fit. |

Avoid `@apply`: it hides which utilities a class uses and creates a second source of truth. A JS helper keeps the bundle visible at the definition site, composes with conditional classes and active states, and runs at SSR time.

### A design system for repeated PRIMITIVES: class helpers built on `@webjsdev/ui`

An `html`-fragment helper is right for a repeated CHUNK of markup (the rubric above). For a repeated UI PRIMITIVE (button, input, card, badge) that needs variants and sizes, use a class helper instead: a function that returns a Tailwind class STRING you spread onto a native element. That is exactly what `@webjsdev/ui` ships (`buttonClass({ variant, size })`, `cardClass()`, `inputClass()`, `badgeClass({ variant })`), and it is what the scaffold gallery uses in `components/ui/`. To style a ONE-OFF that a variant does not cover (a circular icon button, a pill), compose the helper and override the bespoke bits with `cn()`: `cn(buttonClass({ variant: 'secondary', size: 'none' }), 'w-9 h-9 rounded-full')`. `cn` resolves Tailwind conflicts so a later class wins, including a shorthand over the axis it subsumes (`p-0` beats an earlier `px-4 py-2`), so an override just works. For an icon button prefer `size: 'none'` (it states "I supply my own box" by dropping the helper's padding + radius) over layering a `p-0` on top of the default size.

```ts
// components/ui/button.ts  (webjs ui add button, themed to your app)
import { cn } from '#lib/utils/cn.ts';
const BASE = 'inline-flex cursor-pointer items-center justify-center ...';
const VARIANTS = { default: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground ...', secondary: '...' } as const;
const SIZES = { default: 'px-4 py-2 rounded-xl', sm: '...' } as const;
export function buttonClass(o: { variant?: keyof typeof VARIANTS; size?: keyof typeof SIZES } = {}) {
  return cn(BASE, VARIANTS[o.variant ?? 'default'], SIZES[o.size ?? 'default']);
}
```

```ts
// a page or component
import { buttonClass } from '#components/ui/button.ts';
html`<button class=${buttonClass({ variant: 'secondary', size: 'sm' })} @click=${...}>Reset</button>`;
```

Why a class helper (not a `<ui-button>` wrapper): it adds NO indirection, so the element stays native (`@click`, `?disabled`, form submission, focus, a11y all just work) and the markup stays readable, while every button shares one source of truth (so no button can forget `cursor-pointer` or drift). Put the affordance every variant needs (like `cursor-pointer`) on the shared BASE.

**Own and theme your copy.** `webjs ui add <name>` copies the primitive INTO your `components/ui/`, so you own it. Theme it to YOUR app: change the class values so the helper produces YOUR look, rather than bending your app to the kit's defaults. Keep only the parts you use (the gallery's `cardClass` is surface-only, since its panels vary their own padding and layout). Reserve `lib/utils/ui.ts` `html`-fragment helpers for repeated markup chunks; reserve `components/ui/*` class helpers for themed primitives with variants.

## Accessible native controls

A cleared, growing app hand-authors its own controls, so accessibility is your job (the `@webjsdev/ui` primitives carry their own, but a raw `<button>` / `<input>` does not). Three habits keep hand-authored interactive markup accessible on BOTH the JS and no-JS paths:

- **Associate a label with its control.** `<label for="email">` paired with `<input id="email">` (or wrap the control in the `<label>`), so a click on the label focuses the field and a screen reader announces it.
- **State a toggle's pressed state.** A button that toggles carries `aria-pressed=${on}` so assistive tech announces on/off, not just "button".
- **Name an icon-only button.** A button whose only content is an icon has no accessible name, so give it `aria-label="Delete task"`.

Native `<button>` / `<a>` / `<input>` already have correct focus + keyboard behaviour, which is the main reason to prefer them (and the `buttonClass()` / `inputClass()` class helpers) over a custom `<div role>` element.

## Design tokens and theming

The default stack is a static compiled Tailwind stylesheet (`css:build` compiles `public/input.css` to the linked `public/tailwind.css`, so it works with JS off) plus `@theme` design tokens declared once in the root layout. You consume them as utility classes (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-card`, `border-border`, `font-serif`).

**Two halves.** (1) `public/input.css` MAPS token names into Tailwind with `@theme inline` (`--color-background: var(--background)`), so `bg-background` resolves to `var(--background)`. That is infrastructure; leave it. (2) The root layout (`app/layout.ts`) DEFINES the values as plain CSS custom properties in a `<style>` block. That is your palette; make it your own. A freshly cleared app (after `npm run gallery:clear`) ships only the OS system-colour base (`Canvas` / `CanvasText`) with NO tokens, so building this palette is your first styling step.

**Light and dark, defined once (DRY).** Write each colour token ONE time with the native CSS `light-dark(LIGHT, DARK)` function and let `color-scheme` pick the side. The default `color-scheme: light dark` follows the OS; a `[data-theme]` attribute forces one. No duplicated light/dark blocks:

```html
<style>
  :root {
    --font-sans: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;
    color-scheme: light dark;                        /* follow the OS by default */
    --background:       light-dark(#ffffff, #1e2226);
    --foreground:       light-dark(#191c20, #dee2e6);
    --card:             light-dark(#f7f8fa, #313539);
    --muted-foreground: light-dark(#565c64, #94989c);
    --border:           light-dark(#e2e5e9, #34393e);
    --primary:          light-dark(#1e2226, #dee2e6);
    /* a derived token tracks BOTH themes for free via var(--primary) */
    --primary-tint: color-mix(in srgb, var(--primary) 22%, transparent);
  }
  :root[data-theme='light'] { color-scheme: light; }  /* the toggle forces a scheme */
  :root[data-theme='dark']  { color-scheme: dark; }
</style>
```

`light-dark()` is a native CSS function (CSS Color 5, Baseline 2024), not a library, so nothing to import. A single-theme app drops the `[data-theme]` rules and gives each token one colour.

**A manual theme toggle** writes `data-theme` on `<html>` (`light` / `dark`, or removes it for "follow the OS"). If you use `@webjsdev/ui` components, ALSO keep the `.dark` class in sync (the ui kit keys its own tokens off `.dark`), and apply the saved choice in a tiny inline `<script>` in the layout head so there is no first-paint flash. Verify dark mode in a real browser. Light mode passing proves nothing about dark.

**Edge cases.** `light-dark()` is COLOUR-only. A colour needed in just one theme sets the unused side to a no-op (`light-dark(#fff, transparent)`). A derived token that references a `light-dark()` one (like `--primary-tint` above) tracks both themes automatically. A NON-colour token that must differ per theme (a shadow's geometry, a gradient, a size, an image) cannot use `light-dark()`; give it a `:root[data-theme='dark']` override plus an `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root:not([data-theme]) { ... } }` rule for the OS default.

**The ui class helpers build on these tokens.** `buttonClass()` / `cardClass()` / `inputClass()` / `badgeClass()` emit Tailwind utilities that reference the same tokens (`bg-primary`, `border-border`), so theming the tokens re-skins every helper at once.

**Focus rings.** The design system applies ONE themed, keyboard-only focus ring globally (the shadcn convention `@layer base { * { @apply border-border outline-ring/50 } }` in the theme CSS), so every focusable element (button, link, input) shares a `--ring`-coloured `:focus-visible` outline with no per-element styling. Do NOT re-add a focus style on a light-DOM element (`buttonClass` deliberately carries none), and NEVER remove it (`outline: none` with no replacement fails WCAG 2.4.7). `:focus-visible` already limits the ring to keyboard / programmatic focus, not a mouse click. A SHADOW-DOM component is the ONE exception: a document rule cannot cross the shadow boundary, so it styles its own focus in `static styles`, matching the global ring EXACTLY (`--ring` at 50%, the same as `outline-ring/50`): `button:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-ring) 50%, transparent); outline-offset: 2px }`. Without it, its controls fall back to the raw browser outline (thick, light on a dark theme, and shown on window-refocus).

## Light-DOM host display, and shadow hosts

A custom element is `display: inline` in plain CSS, which collapses a component used as a block container to its content size. WebJs marks every LIGHT-DOM host `data-wj-host` and defaults it to `display: block` via one head rule in a low-priority cascade layer (`@layer webjs-host { :where([data-wj-host]) { display: block } }`), so a container component does not collapse. The layer keeps it overridable: any author style INCLUDING a Tailwind utility (`class="flex"`, `grid`, `hidden`) wins over it, and `[hidden]` still hides the host so `?hidden=${cond}` works. Opt into an inline light component with a tag-prefixed rule (`my-badge { display: inline }`).

Shadow-DOM hosts are NOT marked (a document rule would override the shadow tree's own `:host`), so a shadow component sets its host display the idiomatic way in `static styles`:

```ts
static styles = css`:host { display: block }`;   // a shadow host with no :host display stays inline
```

**Size the HOST, not just an inner wrapper.** The host custom element is the box the parent lays out. A host that is a flex/grid item in a centering parent (`flex justify-center`, `grid place-items-center`) is sized to its content unless it carries width itself. Put the sizing classes on the host (`w-full max-w-[400px]`), not only on an inner `<div>`. Symptom: a board or card renders tiny even though its inner grid says `w-full max-w-[400px]`. Fix: move the sizing onto the host.

## Even grids, no reflow

The reflow bug (a cell grows when it gets content while the others shrink) comes from `auto`-sized grid rows. Size the tracks explicitly so every cell is an equal fraction regardless of content:

```html
<!-- a 3x3 board whose cells stay equal and square as it fills -->
<div class="grid gap-2 aspect-square [grid-template-columns:repeat(3,1fr)] [grid-template-rows:repeat(3,1fr)]">
  ${cells.map((c) => html`
    <button class="grid place-items-center min-h-0 overflow-hidden text-[clamp(1rem,8cqi,3rem)]">${c}</button>
  `)}
</div>
```

- `aspect-ratio` (e.g. `aspect-square`) on the CONTAINER plus `repeat(N,1fr)` columns AND rows keeps every cell an equal square that does not resize as marks are placed. Putting `aspect-square` on the CELLS is the common mistake that produces uneven rows.
- `min-h-0` + `overflow-hidden` on a cell stops its content forcing the track taller (a grid/flex child has an implicit `min-height: auto`).
- Size text relative to the cell (`clamp()`, container-query units `cqi`) so the glyph scales with the board rather than dictating the cell size.

Verify a layout by USING it, not by glancing at the first paint. A layout bug only shows mid-interaction: play through every state (fill the board, win, reload) and confirm nothing resizes.

## Pin a header with `position: fixed`, never `sticky`

A `position: sticky` header (the common `sticky top-0` pattern) flickers its background for one frame on iOS WebKit (every iOS browser uses WebKit) during a client-router forward navigation. The router's scroll-to-top after the content swap drives a sticky recompute that WebKit mis-repaints. It is iOS-only (fine on desktop and Android, invisible in DevTools emulation), and neither compositor promotion (`translateZ(0)` / `will-change`) nor changing the swap paint timing fixes it. Preserving the header across nav is correct and standard, only the `sticky` positioning is the problem.

The fix is `position: fixed`. A fixed header is always pinned and never does the scroll-relative recompute, so the repaint bug never fires. Because fixed leaves normal flow, reserve the header height on the content below with a single `--header-h` custom property (kept exact with a `ResizeObserver`, degrading fine with no JS):

```css
:root  { --header-h: 56px; }              /* sane SSR first-paint default */
header { position: fixed; inset-inline: 0; top: 0; }
body   { padding-top: var(--header-h); }
```
```js
const hdr = document.querySelector('header');
const apply = () => document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--header-h', hdr.offsetHeight + 'px');
apply();
new ResizeObserver(apply).observe(hdr);
```

For a dashboard, an alternative is an app-shell scroll container (a non-scrolling `100dvh` flex column with `<main>` as the internal scroller), which needs no offset but changes the scroll model.
