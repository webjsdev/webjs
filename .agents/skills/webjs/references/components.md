# Components

## What This Covers

- Declaring reactive properties through the `WebComponent({ ... })` factory and `prop()`, with options (`reflect`, `state`, `attribute`, `default`, `converter`, `hasChanged`)
- Signals as the default state primitive for component-local and shared state, plus `effect` / `batch`
- The Lit-aligned lifecycle and exactly which hooks SSR runs versus skips
- Light DOM (default) versus shadow DOM, and the light-host `display: block` rule
- Slots with full shadow-DOM parity in both DOM modes
- `async render()`: SSR-blocking first paint, client stale-while-revalidate, `renderFallback()` / `renderError()`
- `Task` for client-only async data, and context (`createContext` / `ContextProvider` / `ContextConsumer`) to avoid attribute drilling
- The lit-html directive set (`repeat`, `watch`, `live`, `keyed`, `guard`, `cache`, `until`, `unsafeHTML`, `ref`, `asyncAppend` / `asyncReplace`, `templateContent`)
- Display-only elision (when a component is stripped from the browser)
- Inherited members app code must NOT shadow (`title`, `remove`, `render`, ...)

## Reactive properties: the base-class factory

Reactive properties are declared by passing their shape into `WebComponent({ ... })`. The types flow automatically to `this.<prop>`, so there is NO `static properties` block and NO `declare` line (a `static properties` block throws at runtime, caught by `no-static-properties`).

```ts
import { WebComponent, prop, html } from '@webjsdev/core';

class Dialog extends WebComponent({
  open: prop(Boolean, { reflect: true }),                       // reflects to the `open` attribute
  showClose: prop(Boolean, { attribute: 'show-close-button' }), // custom attribute name
  variant: prop<'info' | 'danger'>(String, { reflect: true }),  // narrowed union type
  student: prop<Student>(Object),                               // narrowed object type
  items: prop<Tag[]>(Array),                                    // array-typed prop uses Array, not Object
  internal: prop({ state: true }),                             // internal state, no attribute, no type
}) {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.open = false;             // set defaults in the constructor, after super()
    this.student = { name: '', email: '' };
    this.items = [];
  }
  render() {
    return html`<button ?disabled=${!this.open}>${this.variant}</button>`;
  }
}
Dialog.register('ui-dialog');
```

The bare form is shorthand: `count: Number` means `prop(Number)`. Use `prop()` to pass options or narrow the TS type.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | `String` | Constructor feeding the default attribute converter |
| `reflect` | `false` | Property changes write back to the HTML attribute |
| `state` | `false` | Internal-only. No attribute, not observed |
| `attribute` | derived from name | The HTML attribute name the property rides |
| `default` | none | Declarative initial value (a function runs per instance for a fresh object / array) |
| `hasChanged` | strict `!==` | Custom change detection |
| `converter` | type-based | Custom attribute-to-property serialization |

For an array-typed prop pass `Array`, not `Object` (`array-prop-uses-array-type` flags the `Object` form). For anything the built-in converters cannot parse (Date, Map, Set) supply a `converter`.

**Never use a class-field declaration OR initializer** (`count = 0`, `student: Student = {...}`, `todos!: Todo[]`). Under `useDefineForClassFields` even a type-only `todos!: Todo[]` compiles to define an own property after `super()`, which clobbers the prototype's reactive accessor and silently breaks reactivity. Only declare props in the factory and read/write them off `this`. The `reactive-props-no-class-field` rule catches this.

## Signals are the default state primitive

Reserve the factory for values that ride an HTML attribute, reflect to one, or arrive via `.prop=${value}` SSR hydration. For everything else use signals.

```ts
import { signal, computed } from '@webjsdev/core';

const cart = signal<Item[]>([]);                 // module-scope: shared across components, survives navigations
const count = computed(() => cart.get().length); // derived
```

Read with `signal.get()` inside `render()`; the built-in `SignalWatcher` tracks the read and re-renders on change. An instance signal created in the constructor is component-local. For a fine-grained DOM swap use `${watch(signal)}` from `@webjsdev/core/directives`.

Two more signal primitives from `@webjsdev/core` cover client-side reactions and batched writes:

- `effect(fn)` runs `fn` now and re-runs it whenever a signal it read changes. It is a BROWSER-ONLY side-effect primitive (a subscription, a `document.title` sync, an analytics ping), not a render path. It returns a disposer, so create it in `connectedCallback` and call the disposer in `disconnectedCallback` to avoid a leak.
- `batch(fn)` coalesces several `.set()` writes inside `fn` into ONE re-render instead of one per write. Reach for it when a handler updates multiple signals at once.

```ts
import { signal, effect, batch } from '@webjsdev/core';
const open = signal(false), count = signal(0);
connectedCallback() { super.connectedCallback(); this.dispose = effect(() => { document.title = `(${count.get()})`; }); }
disconnectedCallback() { super.disconnectedCallback(); this.dispose?.(); }
reset() { batch(() => { open.set(false); count.set(0); }); }   // one re-render, not two
```

## Lifecycle (Lit-aligned) and what SSR runs

Each update cycle runs these in order; each receives a `changedProperties` Map.

| # | Hook | When |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `shouldUpdate(changed)` | Return `false` to skip. Default `true`. |
| 2 | `willUpdate(changed)` | Pre-render. Assignments here fold into THIS cycle. |
| 3 | `update(changed)` | Default calls `render()` + commits. Override rarely. |
| 4 | `firstUpdated(changed)` | Once, on the first render only. |
| 5 | `updated(changed)` | Every commit. Ad-hoc post-render DOM work. |
| 6 | `updateComplete` resolves | `await el.updateComplete` to read post-render DOM in tests. |

**SSR runs only the value-deriving path**: the constructor, attribute application, `willUpdate` (and controllers' `hostUpdate`), `reflect: true` reflection, then `render()`. It does NOT invoke `connectedCallback`, `disconnectedCallback`, `firstUpdated`, `updated`, `update`'s DOM commit, `hostUpdated`, or `shouldUpdate`. So set first-paint defaults in the constructor, derive SSR-visible state in `willUpdate`, and keep browser-only work (DOM queries, layout, `localStorage`, viewport) in `connectedCallback` / `firstUpdated`. A browser global in the constructor or `render()` throws at SSR (flagged by `no-browser-globals-in-render`; attribute methods and `closest()` are shimmed).

## Light DOM (default) vs shadow DOM

Light DOM is the default: global CSS and Tailwind utilities apply directly, no `:host` or CSS-var plumbing. Set `static shadow = true` only for `static styles = css\`...\`` scoped styles, third-party embed isolation, or the native `::slotted()` selector.

```ts
class Panel extends WebComponent({ label: String }) {
  static shadow = true;
  static styles = css`:host { display: block } .body { padding: 16px }`;
  render() { return html`<div class="body">${this.label}</div>`; }
}
```

- A light-DOM component authoring custom CSS MUST prefix every class selector with its tag name (`.my-card__body` or `my-card .body`). Prefer Tailwind, unique by construction. `static styles` on a light-DOM component is silently ignored.
- **Never interpolate into a component's `<style>` or `<script>` body** (`html\`<style>${x}</style>\``). The server emits it but the client drops the raw-text hole, so it paints then wipes to empty on hydrate (flagged by `no-interpolation-in-raw-text-element`). Use `static styles` or Tailwind.
- Light-DOM hosts are marked `display: block` via one low-priority `@layer webjs-host` rule (overridable by any Tailwind utility). Shadow hosts are NOT marked; set `:host { display: block }` in `static styles`. Size the HOST (put `w-full max-w-[...]` on the render root), not only an inner wrapper. See `styling.md`.

## Slots

The full `<slot>` surface works in light DOM with shadow-DOM parity; migrating modes never requires a template rewrite. A forwarded slot projects its content everywhere (client, SSR, hydration).

```ts
class MyCard extends WebComponent {
  render() {
    return html`
      <header><slot name="header"></slot></header>
      <main><slot></slot></main>
      <footer><slot name="footer">no actions</slot></footer>`;
  }
}
```

Named slots, the default slot (unnamed children, text, comments), fallback content (a slot's inner markup when nothing matches), and first-wins resolution all behave per spec. The DOM API mirrors shadow slots: `assignedNodes` / `assignedElements` (with `{ flatten: true }`), `element.assignedSlot`, and the `slotchange` event. Both modes are SSR'd (light DOM places children into `<slot data-webjs-light data-projection="actual">`, shadow DOM via Declarative Shadow DOM), so slotted content renders with no JS.

**Light-DOM slots ARE the native DOM slot API (#1021, full shadow parity).** There is no WebJs-specific slot API. Post-mount writes are live exactly as in shadow DOM, and moving a component between `static shadow = false` and `true` never needs a rewrite:

```ts
const card = document.querySelector('my-card');
card.appendChild(node);                         // live, projected
card.querySelector('[slot=old]').slot = 'new';  // flip re-projects
card.innerHTML = '<p>replaced</p>';             // replaces slotted content
card.querySelector('slot').assignedNodes();     // read, mirrors shadow
node.assignedSlot;
card.querySelector('slot').addEventListener('slotchange', ...); // async + coalesced
```

Things to internalize. (1) Every native mutation is live: `appendChild` / `insertBefore` / `removeChild` / `el.remove()` / `innerHTML` / `el.slot=` flip / `HTMLSlotElement.assign()`. Reorder-by-append moves a child to the end (native semantics), a fragment expands and drains, and `insertBefore` against a renderer/non-child ref throws `NotFoundError`. One caveat rides `assign()`: the light-DOM version is an EXTENSION (an element-bound overlay while name matching keeps working), and native shadow `assign()` needs `slotAssignment: 'manual'` which WebJs does not set, so `assign()` is the one write that does NOT survive flipping to `static shadow = true`; avoid it in mode-portable components. (2) Four inherent gaps (from light DOM having no shadow boundary). The gaps: structural host reads (`host.children` / `host.childNodes` / `querySelector(':scope > ...')` / the `innerHTML` GETTER read the rendered template, not the authored children, so read slotted content with `assignedNodes()`); `assignedChild.parentNode` is the `<slot>`; `::slotted()` CSS is shadow-only (style slotted content with normal selectors / Tailwind); and initial-projection lifecycle timing (`firstUpdated` sees the `<slot>` element with EMPTY `assignedNodes()`, because the first light-DOM projection lands one microtask after the first render, where shadow DOM projects natively before it; read assigned content from a `slotchange` listener or after a microtask). (3) Conditional-on-slot at render time does not exist in EITHER mode (a shadow template can't branch on light-child presence at render time either); use CSS `:has()` / `slot:empty` or a `slotchange` listener. (4) The name `default` is a reserved alias for the default slot; do not name a slot `default`. (5) A display-only slotted wrapper still elides; a component whose slots are mutated at runtime is already shipped because a consumer references its tag (force a ship with `static interactive = true` only for a dynamically-resolved reference the analyser cannot see). (6) A generic DOM library should operate on the assigned nodes, never on the host element itself; writes into an ACTIVELY ASSIGNED slot container are folded into the record (self-heal), while a fallback-mode slot's content is renderer-owned and out of contract. (7) A FORWARDED slot projects its content everywhere (#1023): a template may forward a slot into a nested component (html`<inner-shell><slot></slot></inner-shell>`), and the outer component's content projects through it on a client-only mount, in the SSR first paint, and across hydration (no flash back to fallback). The renderer stamps each slot with its template owner (carried across SSR as `data-wj-slot-owner`), so a forwarded slot routes to the outer host that rendered it, not the child it nests in. (8) A LAYOUT's named slots stay in sync across soft navigation (#1024): when a layout renders its `${children}` inside a slotted shell and a page emits top-level `slot=`-attributed children, the named-slot slices update on a soft-nav boundary swap just as the default slice does (the swap resyncs every own slot of the enclosing shell from the incoming page).

A compound child reads its parent at the first server paint via `closest('ui-tabs')` (only tag-name selectors resolve at SSR, and the compound parent must be light DOM). Genuine live-DOM reads (`querySelector`, `classList`, geometry) still throw at SSR, so keep them in `connectedCallback` / `firstUpdated`.

## Async render: first-paint server data

`render()` may be `async`, so a leaf component fetches its own server data into the first paint with no prop-drilling.

```ts
class UserActivity extends WebComponent({ uid: String }) {
  renderFallback() { return html`<div class="skeleton h-24"></div>`; } // optional, re-fetch only
  async render() {
    const items = await getActivity(this.uid); // 'use server' action: real fn at SSR, RPC stub on client
    return html`<ul>${items.map((i) => html`<li>${i.label}</li>`)}</ul>`;
  }
}
```

Three decoupled concerns, do not conflate them.

1. **SSR always blocks by default.** The server awaits `async render()`, so the resolved data is baked into the first paint. There is no first-paint fallback, ever (a progressive-enhancement upgrade over a client-fetched `Task`).
2. **The client re-fetch default is stale-while-revalidate.** When a prop or dependency change re-runs `async render()`, the previous content stays until the new render resolves. No blank, no flash, no user code.
3. **`renderFallback()` is the OPTIONAL re-fetch loading UI.** Shown ONLY during a client re-fetch, NEVER on first paint, and it does NOT create a server-streaming boundary.

Errors are isolated per component by default (no user code): a thrown `await` renders a component-scoped error state while siblings render, never bubbling to the route `error.ts`. Override `renderError(error)` only to customize it (dev shows the message, prod stays silent).

Decision rules. Use `async render()` for request-time server data that should be in the first paint (the default). Add `renderFallback()` when a client re-fetch's stale content would mislead. Use `Task` / signals for genuinely client-only data (a click, viewport, live updates). For SLOW data where blocking the first byte hurts, wrap the region in `<webjs-suspense .fallback=${html\`Loading...\`}>` to stream it (the only way to show a first-paint fallback; see `client-router-and-streaming.md`). Do NOT fetch in `connectedCallback` for data knowable server-side, and do NOT prop-drill what a leaf can fetch itself.

## Task: client-only async data

For async data that is genuinely CLIENT-only (it depends on a click, viewport, or a live source, so `async render()` cannot bake it in at SSR), use the `Task` reactive controller. It shows its pending state at SSR (staying `INITIAL`), then runs in the browser.

```ts
import { Task, TaskStatus } from '@webjsdev/core/task';

class SearchResults extends WebComponent({ q: String }) {
  #search = new Task(this, {
    task: async ([q], { signal }) => (await fetch(`/api/s?q=${q}`, { signal })).json(),
    args: () => [this.q],   // the args array spreads into the task's first parameter
  });
  render() {
    switch (this.#search.status) {
      case TaskStatus.PENDING: return html`<p>Searching...</p>`;
      case TaskStatus.ERROR:   return html`<p>${this.#search.error.message}</p>`;
      case TaskStatus.COMPLETE: return html`<ul>${this.#search.value.map((r) => html`<li>${r.title}</li>`)}</ul>`;
      default: return html`<p>Type to search.</p>`;   // INITIAL (also the SSR state)
    }
  }
}
```

`args()` re-runs the task whenever its return changes; call `this.#task.run()` to trigger it manually. `TaskStatus` is `INITIAL` / `PENDING` / `COMPLETE` / `ERROR`. Prefer `async render()` for server data that should be in the first paint; reach for `Task` only when the data cannot exist until the browser runs.

## Context: share state without attribute drilling

When a value must reach a deep descendant without threading it through every intermediate component's attributes, use context (from `@webjsdev/core/context`). This is a CLIENT-TIME concern: a provider publishes on connect, so context is empty at SSR. For server-known data, pass it through the page function or a `.prop` instead (see `muscle-memory-gotchas.md`).

```ts
import { createContext, ContextProvider, ContextConsumer } from '@webjsdev/core/context';

export const themeContext = createContext<'light' | 'dark'>('theme');

class ThemeRoot extends WebComponent({}) {
  #provider = new ContextProvider(this, { context: themeContext, initialValue: 'dark' });
  toggle() { this.#provider.setValue(this.#provider.value === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'); }
}

class ThemedCard extends WebComponent({}) {
  #theme = new ContextConsumer(this, { context: themeContext, subscribe: true }); // re-renders on change
  render() { return html`<div class=${this.#theme.value === 'dark' ? 'bg-black' : 'bg-white'}>...</div>`; }
}
```

`subscribe: true` re-renders the consumer on every provider change; omit it for a one-shot read. A component can also fire a `ContextRequestEvent` to pull a value imperatively.

## Directives (lit-html parity)

Import from `@webjsdev/core/directives`. Everything a `class`/`style`/conditional needs is plain JS (`classMap` is `class=${cond ? 'a' : 'b'}`, `when` is a ternary, `map` is `.map`); reach for a directive only for the jobs below.

| Directive | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `repeat(items, keyFn, tpl)` | A keyed list where items reorder / insert / remove (preserves DOM + state per key). A static list is a plain `.map`. |
| `watch(signal)` | A fine-grained DOM swap of one signal's value without re-rendering the whole component. |
| `live(value)` | An `input` / `textarea` `.value` bound to state, so a user edit that equals the last committed value still resets. |
| `keyed(key, tpl)` | Force a fresh subtree (discard old DOM + state) when `key` changes. |
| `guard(deps, () => tpl)` | Skip re-rendering an expensive subtree unless `deps` change. |
| `cache(tpl)` | Keep the DOM of an inactive branch around when toggling between templates. |
| `until(promise, fallback)` | Render `fallback` until `promise` resolves (prefer `Task` in a component, `Suspense` for a page). |
| `unsafeHTML(str)` | Render a TRUSTED raw HTML string. NEVER pass user input (XSS). |
| `ref(cb)` / `createRef()` | Get a handle to the rendered DOM node. |
| `asyncAppend(iter)` / `asyncReplace(iter)` | Stream from an async iterable, appending each value or replacing with the latest. |
| `templateContent(el)` | Render the content of a `<template>` element. |

## Display-only elision

A component that does no client-side work renders the same SSR'd HTML with or without its JS, so WebJs strips its import from the served source (and any vendor reachable only through it). This is automatic and conservative. A component stays elidable while it has NONE of:

- an `@event` binding or native handler property (`.onclick`)
- a factory-declared reactive property that is not `{ state: true }`
- an overridden lifecycle hook (including `renderFallback` / `renderError`)
- an imported `signal` / `computed` / `watch` / `Task` / `ref` / streaming directive, or `addController` / `requestUpdate`
- code that runs at module load (a top-level call, non-data `new`, dynamic `import(...)`, top-level `await`); only declarations and `X.register(...)` are allowed
- the dynamic slot READ surface (`slotchange`, `assignedNodes` / `assignedElements` / `assignedSlot`); merely RENDERING a `<slot>` does not ship (the SSR output carries the placed children, so a display-only slotted wrapper is byte-identical without its JS; native-write liveness is consumer-driven and the consumer's tag reference forces the ship)
- being rendered by a component that itself ships

A bare `async render()` (no other signal, light DOM) is elided too: the SSR'd data is the complete first paint. Force shipping with `static interactive = true` when interactivity is invisible to static analysis (a dynamically-built tag string, a `:defined` rule in an external stylesheet). `static shadow = true` always ships (Declarative Shadow DOM re-attaches only during parsing). Turn elision off app-wide with `{ "webjs": { "elide": false } }` or `WEBJS_ELIDE=0`.

## Members app code must not shadow

A `WebComponent` inherits `HTMLElement` (browser) or an `ElementShim` (SSR) plus the framework reactivity base. A reactive prop or method whose NAME collides either fails to compile (`TS2415` for a type-incompatible property, `TS2416` for a method signature) or silently hijacks the native member at runtime. The fix is always to rename. The DOM MUTATION methods WebJs instruments for the light-DOM slot API (`append`, `prepend`, `before`, `after`, `replaceWith`, `replaceChildren`, `remove`, `appendChild`, `insertBefore`, `removeChild`, `replaceChild`) are the dangerous case TypeScript does NOT catch (a shorter override is assignable to the native signature), so a handler named `append()` compiles yet silently never runs. `webjs check`'s `no-shadowed-native-member` rule catches exactly these.

- HTMLElement / Element: `title`, `id`, `slot`, `role`, `hidden`, `dir`, `lang`, `translate`, `draggable`, `tabIndex`, `className`, `dataset`, `remove`, `closest`, `matches`, `focus`, `blur`, `click`, `append` / `prepend`, `before` / `after`. Rename (`postTitle`, `removeItem`, `handleClick`).
- WebComponent base: `render`, `update`, `requestUpdate`, `updated` / `firstUpdated`, `willUpdate` / `shouldUpdate`, `connectedCallback`, `renderError` / `renderFallback`, `addController` / `removeController`, `updateComplete` (#1021: there is no WebJs slot API to override; slots are native). Only override one deliberately, with its exact signature; never repurpose the name for app logic.

Framework-private fields are underscore-prefixed (`_renderRoot`, `_connected`, `_changedProperties`, `_updatePromise`, `_isUpdating`); never declare a prop or field that matches one. Safe, non-inherited names: `label`, `open`, `count`, `value`, `name`, `items`, `todos`, `active`, `variant`, `size`, `checked`, `selected`, `heading`, `message`, `status`. When in doubt, grep the base surface in `node_modules/@webjsdev/core/src/component.js`.
