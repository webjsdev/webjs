# Optimistic UI

## What This Covers

- The declarative `optimistic(host, { source, update })` API (preferred) with `.add(payload, promise)` auto-release
- The imperative `optimistic(signal, value, action)` API for simple boolean flips
- When optimistic UI is appropriate, and when to skip it
- Why you never hand-roll try-catch, cache-and-restore, or temp-ID reconciliation

Read this when a mutation should feel instant, when the client can predict the result of a create/update/delete/like/toggle/reorder before the server confirms it. Sibling refs: `data-and-actions.md` (the server actions and the `ActionResult` envelope these calls invoke), `components.md` (the `WebComponent` host, reactive props, and signals these APIs attach to).

## The Idea

`optimistic()` from `@webjsdev/core` shows a mutation's expected result IMMEDIATELY (the UI feels instant), runs the real server action, and ROLLS BACK automatically on failure. It is the default for every user-facing mutation where the client can construct the expected result from the input. **Never write manual try-catch, cache-and-restore, or temp-ID reconciliation** when `optimistic()` covers the pattern.

## Declarative API (preferred)

`optimistic(host, { source, update })` returns an `OptimisticState<State, Action>` with a `.value` getter and an `.add(payload, promise?)` method. The `source` reads the authoritative state (usually a reactive prop). The `update` reducer transforms that state with each payload. Calling `.add()` pushes an update and schedules a re-render, so `.value` reflects the optimistic state on the next paint.

```ts
import { WebComponent, prop, optimistic, html } from '@webjsdev/core';
import { createTodo } from '#modules/todos/actions/create-todo.server.ts';

class TodoList extends WebComponent({
  todos: prop<Todo[]>(Array),
}) {
  private optimisticTodos = optimistic(this, {
    source: () => this.todos,
    update: (state, title: string) => [
      ...state,
      // A client-only placeholder id for the pending row; the real id arrives
      // from the server on reconcile, so the `as any` cast on this temp row is
      // fine (the row is dropped when the promise settles).
      { id: crypto.randomUUID() as any, title, completed: false, pending: true },
    ],
  });

  async handleSubmit(e: SubmitEvent) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const title = new FormData(e.target as HTMLFormElement).get('title') as string;
    if (!title) return;
    (e.target as HTMLFormElement).reset();

    const promise = createTodo({ title });
    this.optimisticTodos.add(title, promise);

    const result = await promise;
    if (result.success && result.data) {
      // Reconcile: the optimistic entry has ALREADY auto-released (the promise
      // settled), so `this.todos` holds only confirmed rows here. Append the
      // server's canonical row, matching the order the `update` reducer used.
      this.todos = [...this.todos, result.data];
    }
  }

  render() {
    return html`<ul>${this.optimisticTodos.value.map(todo => html`
      <li class=${todo.pending ? 'opacity-50' : ''}>${todo.title}</li>
    `)}</ul>`;
  }
}
TodoList.register('todo-list');
```

**Auto-release is the whole point.** Pass the action's promise as the second argument to `.add(payload, promise)`, and the update auto-releases the moment that promise settles (resolve OR reject). It uses `.finally()`, with a `.then()` fallback for thenables that lack `.finally`. No try-catch, no manual rollback, no temp-ID bookkeeping. On success you reconcile the authoritative row from `result.data` (as above); on failure the optimistic entry simply drops when the promise rejects.

- Multiple `.add()` calls stack independently. Each carries its own release by ID, so overlapping in-flight mutations do not clobber one another.
- When `update` is omitted, the payload REPLACES the state directly (`Action = State`), matching the simple `useOptimistic(setState)` pattern.

## Seed the list from the server for SSR plus optimistic

For a page that server-renders a list AND lets the user add to it optimistically, let ONE component own both the list and the form, and seed it from the page through a `.prop` hole (a DOM property that round-trips through SSR on custom elements). The list is then fully server-rendered on first paint (readable with JS off) and re-renders optimistically on each add. A separate static list in the page would not update on an optimistic add.

```ts
// app/notes/page.ts (runs server-only; awaits the data so it is in the first paint)
import { html } from '@webjsdev/core';
import '#modules/notes/components/note-composer.ts'; // registers <note-composer>
import { listNotes } from '#modules/notes/queries/list-notes.server.ts';

export default async function NotesPage() {
  const notes = await listNotes();
  // .notes=${notes} seeds the component; the list SSRs through the component.
  return html`<note-composer .notes=${notes}></note-composer>`;
}
```

The component reads that seeded prop as its `optimistic()` `source`, so `source: () => this.notes` is both the SSR list and the base for optimistic additions.

## Imperative API (simple boolean flips)

For a boolean toggle where the value itself is the mutation (like, follow, pin), `optimistic(signal, value, action)` is a thin wrapper over the signal primitive.

```ts
import { signal, optimistic } from '@webjsdev/core';
import { likePost } from '#modules/posts/actions/like-post.server.ts';

const liked = signal(false);
// in an @click handler:
const result = await optimistic(liked, true, () => likePost(postId));
// `liked` flips to true instantly. If likePost THROWS or returns
// { success: false }, `liked` rolls back to its prior value: the throw
// re-throws, and the { success: false } result is returned so you can
// read its error / fieldErrors. On success the optimistic value stays;
// reconcile to the authoritative value from `result` if you need it.
```

It rolls back on a thrown error OR an `ActionResult` `{ success: false }` envelope, and never on success. It is client-only (it mutates a signal), so a component importing it is never elided as a display-only component.

## When Optimistic UI Is Appropriate

- Todo items, comments, posts, likes, follows, toggles, reorders, renames, status changes.
- Any mutation where the client can construct the expected result from the input.
- CRUD operations where the server returns the same shape the client already has.

## When To Skip It

- The result is unpredictable (AI-generated content, server-computed values the client cannot guess).
- The mutation has side effects the user must wait for (payment processing, email sending, OAuth).
- The action validates against data that may have changed server-side (unique constraints, race conditions).
- The mutation is destructive and irreversible with no undo (confirm-first UX is better).

## Rules

1. Default to `optimistic()` for every predictable user-facing mutation. Instant UI, automatic rollback.
2. Prefer the declarative `.add(payload, promise)` form for list mutations. Pass the promise so release is automatic.
3. Use the imperative `optimistic(signal, value, action)` form only for a boolean flip whose value is the mutation.
4. Never hand-roll try-catch, cache-and-restore, or temp-ID reconciliation when one of these APIs covers the pattern.
5. Reconcile the authoritative result from the returned `ActionResult` after the promise settles when you need the server's canonical row.
