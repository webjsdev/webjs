# The `@webjsdev/ui` component kit

Load this when the app has a `components.json` (it uses `@webjsdev/ui`, the
shadcn-style kit for WebJs). The source is copied into your repo (`components/ui/`),
so you own and edit it. Two tiers:

- **Tier 1, class helpers (23 components).** Pure functions returning Tailwind
  class strings (`buttonClass({ variant })`, `cardClass()`), composed with
  whatever native element you write. Reach for these instead of expanding
  Tailwind by hand: the call site is a fraction of the tokens and the class list
  cannot drift.
- **Tier 2, stateful custom elements (9 components).** `<ui-dialog>`, `<ui-tabs>`,
  `<ui-dropdown-menu>`, and friends own their ARIA (focus trap, roving tabindex,
  `aria-controls` / `inert`, live regions). Write the tag and the accessible
  behaviour comes with it. Do NOT hand-roll these; the wiring is easy to get
  subtly wrong.

## The workflow: query for the structure, do not guess it

`add` copies a Tier-1 component's class helpers plus a lean header (what each
helper is, the accessibility obligations) and a one-line pointer. It does NOT
copy the worked structural example, because that example is guidance you consume
once while composing, not code that should sit in your repo. Get the full
paste-ready structure on demand:

- **MCP `ui` tool** (preferred when available): call `ui` with no args for the
  kit inventory (each component's tier, helper signatures, npm deps); pass
  `{ name: "accordion" }` for one component's helper signatures, the paste-ready
  structural example, the accessibility header, and deps.
- **CLI**: `webjs ui list` (inventory), `webjs ui view <name>` (the projected
  view plus the full source). Same data as the MCP tool (one shared projector).

So the loop is: `add` the component, then query `ui <name>` (MCP) or
`webjs ui view <name>` for the accessible structure, paste it, and fill it in.

## Setup and resolution

- `webjs ui init` writes `components.json`, `lib/utils.ts`, and the CSS design
  tokens the helpers render against (`--background`, `--foreground`,
  `--destructive`, ...). It HARD-FAILS if the tokens cannot be written, so a
  clean exit means the kit is styled. `add` self-heals the tokens if they go
  missing.
- Resolution is LOCAL-FIRST: `init` / `add` / `list` / `view` read the registry
  that ships inside the installed `@webjsdev/ui`, with no network. This pins you
  to the installed version; run `webjs ui diff` to see where your local copies
  drift from the upstream (that command alone compares against the live registry).

## Inventory (run `webjs ui list` or the MCP `ui` tool for the authoritative, current set)

**Tier 1 (class helpers):** accordion, alert, aspect-ratio, avatar, badge,
breadcrumb, button, card, checkbox, collapsible, input, kbd, label,
native-select, pagination, popover, progress, radio-group, separator, skeleton,
switch, table, textarea.

**Tier 2 (custom elements, own their ARIA):** alert-dialog, dialog,
dropdown-menu, hover-card, sonner, tabs, tooltip, plus toggle and toggle-group
(these two register an element AND export a `*Class` helper).

## Idioms

- A helper is a function, so compose it: `class=${buttonClass({ variant: 'outline' })}`.
  The unquoted `${...}` is a normal `html` attribute hole.
- Tier-1 helpers assume the design tokens exist; if a component paints unstyled,
  the tokens are missing (re-run `webjs ui init` or let `add` self-heal them).
- Custom elements are display-only-safe at SSR and hydrate in the browser, the
  standard WebJs component model (`references/components.md`).

Full per-package reference lives in the installed `@webjsdev/ui/AGENTS.md`.
