# Client Router and Streaming

## What This Covers

- The automatic client router (SPA-style partial swaps), how it opts out, and programmatic `navigate()` / `revalidate()`.
- Link prefetch with device-adaptive defaults.
- `<webjs-frame>` partial-swap regions (WebJs's Turbo Frames).
- View Transitions opt-in.
- `<webjs-stream>` surgical element updates (WebJs's Turbo Streams) and streaming RPC results.
- `Suspense` page-level streaming and `<webjs-suspense>` component-level streaming.
- WebSockets (`connectWS`, the `WS` route export, `broadcast()`).
- The opt-in navigation-loading indicator.

Read this when a task touches client navigation, prefetch, partial-page swaps, streaming, or realtime. For the components that render inside these regions (async render, `renderFallback()`, signals) see `components.md`. For the server actions these features call see `data-and-actions.md`.

## The Client Router

The router auto-enables the moment `@webjsdev/core` loads in the browser, which is any page that ships a component. There is nothing to import or opt into. It intercepts same-origin `<a>` clicks (including inside shadow DOM), fetches the target HTML, and replaces only the inside of the deepest shared layout. Outer header, sidenav, and footer DOM is never re-rendered, so scroll positions, input values, and `<details>` state survive a navigation.

**The nav parse must preserve comments.** SSR wraps each layout's children AND the page itself in a KEYED boundary comment pair (open `<!--wj:children:<segment>:<route-key>-->`, close `<!--/wj:children:<segment>-->`, #1015). The route-key is the region's resolved concrete path with each substituted param value percent-encoded (so a user-controlled value can never terminate the comment or collide with the `:` delimiter). The router STRICTLY scans both the live and incoming DOM into segment maps: a close must id-match its innermost open, and ANY truncation, mispair, duplicate, or legacy anonymous open poisons the whole scan. The swap decision is two-tier with Next.js remount parity: a CHANGED route-key REPLACES (a fresh remount, permanents regrafted) at the PARENT of the shallowest changed boundary (a layout's boundary wraps only its children, so its own param-derived markup lives in the parent's range; anchoring there remounts the layout chrome too, exactly like Next re-rendering the layout with new params), else MORPH (the keyed state-preserving reconcile) at the deepest shared boundary when it is the leaf on both sides. The X-Webjs-Have header carries `segment:route-key` entries so the server re-renders (and re-ships) a dynamic layout the client holds for other params instead of short-circuiting past it. A poisoned scan or no shared segment degrades to a FULL PAGE LOAD (dev logs the cause), never a guessed recovery, so silent DOM corruption is structurally impossible. Hydration keys off another comment (`<!--webjs-hydrate-->`, which `__isHydrating()` reads as a component's first child). So the router and hydration both ride on comments SURVIVING the parse that turns a navigation response into a Document, which makes that parse a load-bearing correctness boundary rather than an implementation detail.

`Document.parseHTMLUnsafe` STRIPS every comment in Chromium 150 (#1007). No other parse API does: `DOMParser`, `setHTMLUnsafe`, `template.innerHTML`, and plain `innerHTML` all preserve them, and so does the document's own navigation parser, which is why a hard refresh always looked correct and only soft nav broke. With the boundaries gone the router degrades to a full page load (correct, just not soft); with `webjs-hydrate` gone a slotted light-DOM component misses the hydration adopt path. `parseHTML` therefore PROBES `parseHTMLUnsafe` once for losslessness instead of sniffing versions, uses it when it is lossless (it is the only single-pass API that also processes Declarative Shadow DOM), and otherwise parses with `DOMParser`, which preserves comments. A fixed browser silently returns to the fast path.

On that fallback, Declarative Shadow DOM is left UNPROCESSED (`DOMParser` does not attach it), a deliberate limitation tracked in #1011, because both ways of adding it back are worse than the gap. Re-serializing via `body.setHTMLUnsafe(body.innerHTML)` is not idempotent (Chromium omits the spec's LF-compensation, so a leading newline in `pre` / `textarea` is silently eaten, which in a `textarea` is form-data corruption), and attaching each root by hand yields a NON-declarative root, which makes any element whose constructor unconditionally calls `attachShadow()` throw `NotSupportedError` on upgrade. The gap costs a JS-less DSD-dependent element its shadow content on a full-body-swap nav, on a stripping browser only; a `static shadow = true` component attaches and renders its own root on upgrade, and a soft nav runs JS by definition.

Note for anyone testing this: **the Chromium web-test-runner currently resolves (148) is LOSSLESS, so CI cannot observe the bug at all** (and `playwright` is a caret range, so that version moves on any dependency refresh). A test that merely asserts "markers survive" passes there whether or not the fix exists. The guard in `packages/core/test/routing/browser/comment-preserving-parse.test.js` SIMULATES a stripping parser so it is provable on every engine.

**There is NO dropped-marker recovery (#1015 replaced #994's).** The pre-#1015 router "recovered" an orphaned open marker by guessing where its children ended (bounded by the other side's trailing-sibling count), which could guess wrong and corrupt silently. Keyed closes make a mispair DETECTABLE instead, and every integrity violation now degrades to a bounded, correct full page load. The historical producers of lost comments (our own comment-stripping parse #1007, mid-parse soft navs #1008) are fixed upstream, so the degradation is a rare backstop, not a common path. Wrapping `${children}` in a container element (the shipped idiom, `<main>${children}</main>` with the footer a sibling outside it) remains a fine layout pattern, though no correctness now depends on it.

**Opting out.** App-wide with config, or per moment at runtime.

```jsonc
// package.json
{ "webjs": { "clientRouter": false } }
```

```js
import { disableClientRouter, enableClientRouter } from '@webjsdev/core';
disableClientRouter();   // stop intercepting document <a> / <form> (plain links resume full loads)
enableClientRouter();    // turn soft navigation back on
```

`disableClientRouter()` / `enableClientRouter()` are a runtime pair that toggle only the document-level `<a>` / `<form>` interception. An explicit `navigate(url)` call still does a soft navigation either way (it is not gated by the toggle).

Per link, opt out with `data-no-router` (auth flows like `/logout`, OAuth redirects, print views, an experimental route with a different runtime). Cross-origin hrefs, `download`, a non-`_self` target, pure same-page hash jumps, and non-HTML extensions are auto-skipped.

**Programmatic navigation and cache eviction.**

```js
import { navigate, revalidate } from '@webjsdev/core';
await navigate('/about');                     // push history
await navigate('/login', { replace: true });  // replace history
revalidate('/products/123');                  // evict one URL from the snapshot cache
revalidate();                                 // clear the entire snapshot cache
```

The router keeps a URL-keyed snapshot cache (LRU, cap 16) so Back/Forward restores instantly, then refetches in the background. Call `revalidate(path)` after a server action mutates data a cached page depends on. Wire bytes are minimized by an `X-Webjs-Have` header, so the server returns only the divergent layout fragment. Concurrent navigations abort the prior in-flight fetch, and scroll is restored on Back/Forward.

**Error recovery.** A 2xx/3xx swap applies in place, and an HTML error body of any status (a 422 re-rendered form, a 5xx error page) is ALSO applied in place with no reload. For a non-HTML error or a transport failure the router dispatches a cancelable `webjs:navigation-error` on `document` (detail `{ url, status, error }`). Call `preventDefault()` to own recovery, otherwise the router renders a minimal in-place alert into the layout slot.

```ts
document.addEventListener('webjs:navigation-error', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  showToast(`Could not load ${e.detail.url} (status ${e.detail.status})`);
});
```

**Form state.** A form submitting through the router gets `aria-busy="true"` for the in-flight duration, plus bubbling `webjs:submit-start` and `webjs:submit-end` (detail `{ form, url, ok }`) events. Style `form[aria-busy="true"]` in pure CSS or listen for the events.

## Link Prefetch

Same-origin in-app links prefetch speculatively so a click resolves from a warm cache. On by default, no per-link opt-in needed. The default strategy is DEVICE-ADAPTIVE, because one strategy cannot serve both input modalities. On a hover-capable fine pointer the default is `intent` (warm on hover/focus after a ~100ms dwell). On touch the default is `viewport` (warm as links settle on-screen), because touch has no hover. Modality is detected with `matchMedia('(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)')`, never a UA sniff.

Override per link with the `data-prefetch` attribute.

```html
<a href="/dashboard">adaptive default (intent on pointer, viewport on touch)</a>
<a href="/dashboard" data-prefetch="intent">hover / focus / touch</a>
<a href="/dashboard" data-prefetch="render">eager on insert</a>
<a href="/dashboard" data-prefetch="viewport">on scroll into view</a>
<a href="/dashboard" data-prefetch="none">never</a>
```

Next-style aliases work (`true` = `render`, `auto` = `viewport`, `false` = `none`). `viewport` uses an IntersectionObserver at threshold 0.5 with a ~250ms dwell, cancelled the instant a link scrolls back out, so a fast scroll spends no requests. Speculation is bounded by a concurrency cap, in-flight de-dupe, and an LRU + TTL cache, and is disabled entirely under `Save-Data`, `prefers-reduced-data`, or a 2g connection. The guiding rule is snappy but never at the cost of bloating the network tab, so when the two conflict the gate under-fetches.

A prefetch issues a real GET, so any mutating endpoint MUST be a POST or a `<form>` submission (which the router never prefetches), never a GET link. A `webjs:prefetch` event fires on `document` when a fragment lands in the cache.

## `<webjs-frame>` Partial-Swap Regions

`<webjs-frame>` is WebJs's take on Turbo Frames, so most `<turbo-frame>` muscle memory transfers. It is a lazy, URL-addressable region that swaps on its own, driven by a link or form targeting its id, and it ships zero component JS. Use it for a region that loads or refreshes INDEPENDENTLY of a full-page navigation (a marketing widget, tabbed UI, a filtered results panel), which a page or layout cannot express.

```ts
html`<webjs-frame id="activity">…contents…</webjs-frame>`
```

On click the router walks `closest('webjs-frame')` from the target. If a frame is found and the response carries a matching `<webjs-frame id>`, the swap is scoped to that frame's children, and the server returns ONLY that subtree.

**External targeting.** A trigger does not have to be nested inside the frame. An `<a>` or `<form>` carrying `data-webjs-frame="<id>"` drives that frame from anywhere (an explicit `data-webjs-frame` wins over the enclosing-frame default). `data-webjs-frame="_top"` is a reserved token forcing a full-page navigation that breaks out of the frame.

**Self-loading.** Give a frame a `src` and it self-fetches (through the same swap path).

```html
<webjs-frame id="rail" src="/widgets/rail"></webjs-frame>            <!-- eager on connect -->
<webjs-frame id="comments" src="/posts/42/comments" loading="lazy">  <!-- fetch on viewport entry -->
  <p>Loading comments...</p>
</webjs-frame>
```

A `src`-driven frame is JS-DEPENDENT (the browser does not natively fetch `<webjs-frame src>`), so use it for DEFERRED content where a JS-off placeholder is acceptable. For content that must exist without JS, render it server-side into the frame. A frame's route can itself use `<webjs-suspense>` to stream slow data behind a fallback. Frame events: `webjs:frame-busy` (both edges, `aria-busy` set for free) and a cancelable `webjs:frame-missing` when the response lacks the requested frame.

## View Transitions (opt-in)

The router can wrap a navigation's DOM mutation in the native View Transitions API so a swap cross-fades instead of snapping. It is OFF by default. Opt in with a meta in any page head (re-read per navigation), mirroring Turbo's convention.

```html
<meta name="view-transition" content="same-origin">
```

A page (or layout) does not write raw `<head>` markup, so emit that meta through the `other` metadata field, which scopes it to the page that declares it:

```ts
// app/gallery/page.ts
export const metadata = { other: { 'view-transition': 'same-origin' } };
```

The accepted value is `same-origin`. When enabled it wraps every swap path (the two-tier boundary swap, the `<webjs-frame>` swap, and the background-revalidation full-body path). When `startViewTransition` is unavailable the swap runs synchronously with no flash and no throw. To persist a live element (a playing `<audio>`, an open menu) across a swap by node identity, mark it `data-webjs-permanent` and give it an `id`.

The opt-in is **per page**, so it is a page-scoped meta: put it on a page's metadata to animate that page, or on the root layout to animate the whole app. Navigating to a page that does NOT declare it turns transitions back off, because the soft-nav head merge reconciles page-scoped `<meta>` tags (a stale one the previous page declared is removed, not left to leak, #1046). View transitions **compose with Suspense streaming**: a streamed boundary (a `loading.{js,ts}` skeleton or a `<webjs-suspense>` region) navigated to under an active transition still resolves its content progressively, because the streamed resolve waits for the transition's DOM swap to commit before it applies (#1048).

## `<webjs-stream>` Surgical Updates

`<webjs-stream>` is WebJs's take on Turbo Streams, and the action set mirrors `<turbo-stream>`. It is the only SINGLE-element update primitive (append one row, remove one item, bump a count, insert a toast), whereas a frame or layout swap redraws a whole region.

```html
<webjs-stream action="append" target="comments">
  <template><li>Nice post!</li></template>
</webjs-stream>
```

Actions: `append` / `prepend` (child of the target id), `before` / `after` (sibling), `replace` (the target itself), `update` (the target's children), `remove` (no template). A `targets="<css-selector>"` applies to every match. There are two delivery paths sharing one applier. Over HTTP a form submission rides the router with `Accept: text/vnd.webjs-stream.html`, and the server returns a stream only when that Accept is present (JS off gets a normal render, so it stays progressive-enhancement-safe). Over a live channel, `renderStream(message)` applies a server-pushed payload.

```ts
// app/post/[id]/route.ts
import { stream, streamResponse, acceptsStream, broadcast } from '@webjsdev/server';

export async function POST(req: Request, { params }) {
  const comment = await addComment(params.id, await req.formData());
  const parts = stream.append('comments', `<li>${escapeHtml(comment.text)}</li>`);
  broadcast(`post:${params.id}`, parts);              // fan out to every viewer
  if (acceptsStream(req)) return streamResponse(parts);
  return Response.redirect(`/post/${params.id}`, 303); // no-JS fallback
}
```

`stream.*` escapes the target id but NOT the content, so escape any user substring yourself, exactly like an `html` hole.

## Streaming (Suspense and RPC)

**Page-level streaming (`Suspense`).** Pass a promise as `children` to defer a slow region behind a fallback. TTFB is the time to render everything outside the boundary, and the resolved content streams in as a `<template>` when the promise lands.

```js
import { html, Suspense } from '@webjsdev/core';
export default function Page() {
  return html`<h1>Catalogue</h1>
    ${Suspense({ fallback: html`<p>Loading…</p>`, children: fetchExpensive() })}`;
}
```

**Component-level streaming (`<webjs-suspense>`).** An `async render()` component BLOCKS the first byte by default (real data in the first paint). To STREAM a slow component behind a fallback instead, wrap it. Multiple boundaries fetch concurrently, and a throwing component is isolated to its own error state while siblings stream.

```js
html`<webjs-suspense .fallback=${html`<p>Loading section…</p>`}>
  <user-profile uid="42"></user-profile>
</webjs-suspense>`
```

**Streaming RPC results.** A `'use server'` action that RETURNS a `ReadableStream`, async iterable, or async generator streams its chunks over the single RPC response. Detection is purely on the return value, so no config export is needed. This is the token-stream or progress case consumed imperatively after an interaction.

```ts
'use server';
export async function* streamAnswer(prompt: string) {
  for await (const token of llm.complete(prompt)) yield token;
}
// inside a component:
for await (const token of await streamAnswer(q)) this.text.set(this.text.get() + token);
```

Back-pressure is respected, and the request `AbortSignal` cancels the source on a client disconnect or a superseded render. A mid-stream throw surfaces as an error from the iterable, so wrap the `for await` in `try/catch`. For a slow region you want behind a fallback on the FIRST paint, use `<webjs-suspense>` instead.

## WebSockets

**Server.** Export `WS` from a `route.{js,ts}` file. In dev the module re-imports per connection, so keep shared state on `globalThis`.

```js
export function WS(ws, req, { params }) {
  ws.on('message', (data) => ws.send('echo:' + data));
  ws.on('close', () => { /* cleanup */ });
}
```

**Client.** `connectWS(url, handlers)` from `@webjsdev/core` auto-reconnects with exponential backoff, handles JSON parse/stringify, and queues sends while disconnected. The handler set is `{ onOpen, onMessage, onClose }`, and it RETURNS a connection handle with `.send(data)` and `.close()`. Open it in `connectedCallback` and close it in `disconnectedCallback`, driving a connection-status signal from `onOpen` / `onClose`:

```js
import { connectWS, renderStream } from '@webjsdev/core';

connectedCallback() {
  super.connectedCallback();
  this.conn = connectWS('/feed', {
    onOpen:    () => (this.online = true),
    onClose:   () => (this.online = false),
    onMessage: (m) => renderStream(m),   // apply a server-pushed <webjs-stream> payload
  });
}
disconnectedCallback() { super.disconnectedCallback(); this.conn?.close(); }
send(text) { this.conn.send(text); }
```

**Gotcha: a component re-render clobbers surgical `renderStream()` updates.** `renderStream()` (and `<webjs-stream>` in general) mutates the DOM out of band, appending rows the component's own `render()` does not know about. If the component then re-renders, `render()` re-runs and wipes those out-of-band rows. So render the target container ONCE and drive any mutation counter with a PLAIN instance field, never a signal or reactive prop that `render()` reads (a read would re-render and blow away the streamed-in DOM).

**Broadcast.** `broadcast(path, data)` from `@webjsdev/server` fans a message to every connected client on that path (single-instance). For multi-instance, add Redis pub/sub yourself, there is no framework magic.

## Navigation-Loading Indicator (opt-in)

For a CSS-only progress affordance while a navigation is in flight, add `data-webjs-nav-progress` to `<html>` once in the root layout. The router then sets `data-navigating` on `<html>` during a nav (deferred 150ms, so quick navs never trigger it). Style off that attribute.

```html
<html data-webjs-nav-progress>
```

```css
html[data-navigating] { cursor: progress; }
html[data-navigating]::after {
  content: ''; position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; height: 2px;
  background: var(--accent); animation: progress 1s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

It is opt-in because toggling an `<html>` attribute re-resolves `oklch()` / `color-mix()` tokens on WebKit (every iOS browser), which flashes the background for one frame on a token-driven theme. Enable it only when your theme does not lean on wide-gamut color tokens, otherwise use the JS path (listen for `webjs:navigate`, and `webjs:submit-start` for forms).
