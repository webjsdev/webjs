# Build a WebJs App

Use this skill for end-to-end WebJs app work. It helps you choose the right layer first, reach for the right export, and avoid the WebJs-specific mistakes that Next.js or Lit muscle memory causes. WebJs is its own framework: the component API matches Lit and the routing feels like Next, but the execution model is neither.

## Full Documentation

This skill is the quick guide. When you need the full API reference for a surface, load the matching file in `references/` (listed below). For even deeper framework detail, WebJs ships buildless, so the source you run IS the source you read: look in `node_modules/@webjsdev/{core,server,cli}/` (each package ships its own `AGENTS.md`). The complete hosted docs live at https://docs.webjs.dev.

## What WebJs Is

WebJs is an AI-first, web-components-first framework with **no build step**: source files are served as native ES modules, and TypeScript is stripped in place (Node 24+ or Bun). It runs SSR + progressive enhancement by default.

**There is no server/client component split.** No RSC render tree, no Flight protocol, no `"use client"` boundary. Instead:

- **Pages and layouts** (`app/**/page.ts`, `app/**/layout.ts`) run **only on the server** to produce HTML. They do NOT hydrate, so their own markup cannot be interactive (an `@click` in a page template is dropped at SSR). They still LOAD in the browser so imported components register.
- **Components** (`WebComponent` custom elements) hydrate per element, islands-style. **All interactivity lives here**: `@event`, reactive property assignment, signal mutation.
- **`*.server.ts`** is the one server boundary. With `'use server'` its exports are RPC-callable from the client (the import is rewritten to a stub); without it the file is a server-only utility whose browser import throws at load. This, not a component annotation, is how a dependency (the DB driver, secrets, `node:*`) is kept off the client.
- **`route.ts`** is a server-only HTTP handler (named `GET`/`POST` exports), the one routing file that is NOT isomorphic.

**Progressive enhancement is the default architecture.** With JS off, content reads, `<a>` navigates, and `<form>` server actions submit. JS is opt-in per interactive behaviour. Never write a first paint that depends on hydration.

## When To Use This Skill

- New features or refactors touching pages, routes, actions, components, data, auth, sessions, styling, or tests
- Reviewing WebJs code for correctness or framework usage
- Answering "how should this be structured in WebJs?"
- Finding the right export, reference doc, or default pattern for a task

## Load Only The References You Need

Classify the task first, then load the smallest useful reference set. Each reference starts with a "What This Covers" section; read that to confirm relevance before reading the rest. Loading more than two or three at once usually means the task is not narrowed yet.

| Task involves...                                                            | Start with                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pages, layouts, dynamic routes, route handlers, metadata, redirects, 404s   | `references/routing-and-pages.md`             |
| Writing components: reactive props, signals, lifecycle, light vs shadow DOM  | `references/components.md`                     |
| Server actions, mutations, queries, validation, the `ActionResult` envelope | `references/data-and-actions.md`              |
| Sessions, login flows, route protection, `forbidden()` / `unauthorized()`   | `references/auth-and-sessions.md`             |
| Tailwind, light-DOM tag-prefix rule, tokens, fixed headers, no-reflow layout | `references/styling.md`                        |
| Client router, prefetch, frames, view transitions, Suspense streaming        | `references/client-router-and-streaming.md`   |
| Optimistic UI for a user-facing mutation                                     | `references/optimistic-ui.md`                 |
| The `@webjsdev/ui` component kit (a `components.json` is present): class helpers, tokens, `add` / `view`, the MCP `ui` tool | `references/ui-kit.md`                         |
| TypeScript at runtime, erasable syntax, full-stack types                     | `references/typescript.md`                     |
| Unit, browser, e2e tests, the `handle()` harness, Bun parity                 | `references/testing.md`                        |
| Auth, caching, env vars, rate limit, file storage, the `webjs` config block  | `references/built-ins.md`                      |
| Node vs Bun, running the app, deploying, runtime-specific differences        | `references/runtime.md`                        |
| Offline support, an asset cache, the opt-in service worker                   | `references/service-worker.md`                 |
| A pattern that feels like Next.js or Lit but might not transfer              | `references/muscle-memory-gotchas.md`         |

Common bundles:

- **Form or CRUD feature** then routing-and-pages, data-and-actions, testing; add auth if user-specific
- **Interactive widget** then components, styling; add client-router-and-streaming only if it streams
- **Protected area** then auth-and-sessions, routing-and-pages, testing
- **Instant-feeling mutation** then data-and-actions, optimistic-ui

## Default Workflow

1. **Classify the change.** Route contract, data model, server mutation, auth, or only UI?
2. **Start from the server.** Add the page/route and its server action or query before wiring interactive UI. A page render or a `<form>` POST should already return correct HTML before any component hydrates.
3. **Put code in the narrowest owner.** Route-local first (`modules/<feature>/`), promote to `lib/` or `components/` only when reuse is real.
4. **Keep server-only code behind `.server.ts`.** The DB driver, secrets, and `node:*` never belong in a page, layout, or component.
5. **Add interactivity per behaviour.** Reach for a component (and a signal or `@event`) only where the UI is genuinely interactive. A display-only component is elided from the browser.
6. **Validate input at the boundary.** Declare `export const validate` on an action; the RPC and `route()` boundaries run it.
7. **Default mutations to optimistic UI** where the client can predict the result (`optimistic()` from `@webjsdev/core`).
8. **Test the narrowest meaningful layer**, and render the app in a real browser for any UI change (static checks do not catch a collapsed layout).

## Project Layout

```
app/                  ROUTING ONLY (thin adapters importing from modules/)
  layout.ts           root layout (the ONLY file that may write <html>/<head>/<body>)
  page.ts             /
  <segment>/page.ts   /<segment>
  [param]/page.ts     dynamic route (params.param)
  <path>/route.ts     HTTP handler at /<path>
  error.ts loading.ts not-found.ts forbidden.ts unauthorized.ts   boundaries (nearest wins)
middleware.ts         root middleware
modules/<feature>/    actions/ (mutations, *.server.ts), queries/ (reads, *.server.ts),
                      components/, utils/ (pure), types.ts
lib/                  lib/*.server.ts server-only infra, lib/utils/ browser-safe helpers
components/*.ts        shared presentational custom elements (one per file)
db/*.server.ts        Drizzle: schema, connection
public/*              static assets, served at /public/<name>
```

App-internal imports use the `#` root alias (`import { db } from '#db/connection.server.ts'`), Node's native `package.json` imports field, not deep `../../../` relatives. A same-directory import stays relative.

## Core WebJs Rules (invariants)

1. Server-only code lives in `.server.ts`, `route.ts`, or `middleware.ts`. Never in a page, layout, or component (it crashes the browser at module load).
2. `'use server'` exports are `async` functions returning serializer-safe values. Files without `'use server'` are server-only utilities.
3. Custom element tag names contain a hyphen. Pass the tag to `Class.register('tag-name')`.
4. Event (`@`), property (`.`), and boolean (`?`) holes in `html` are UNQUOTED: `@click=${fn}`, never `@click="${fn}"`.
5. Signals are the default state primitive. Import `signal` / `computed` from `@webjsdev/core`, read via `signal.get()` inside `render()`. The base-class factory `WebComponent({ ... })` is only for values riding an HTML attribute or arriving via SSR hydration.
6. Page and layout default exports are functions returning a value; they never call `render()` themselves.
7. Light-DOM components with custom CSS prefix every class selector with their tag name. Prefer Tailwind (unique by construction).
8. Only the root layout may write `<!doctype>` / `<html>` / `<head>` / `<body>`.
9. No backtick characters inside an `html\`...\`` body, even in comments (it closes the literal and 500s).
10. TypeScript must be erasable (`erasableSyntaxOnly: true`): no `enum`, no value `namespace`, no constructor parameter properties, no legacy decorators.
11. Reactive properties are declared ONLY through the base-class factory `extends WebComponent({ count: Number })`. Never a `static properties` block, never a class-field initializer (it clobbers the reactive accessor).

## Export Map

Find the right export fast. Load the linked reference for full examples.

### `@webjsdev/core` (browser + isomorphic)

- `html` / `css` tagged templates. `WebComponent({ ... })` base-class factory; `prop(type?, opts?)` declares one reactive property. `register(tag, C)` / `Class.register('tag')`.
- `signal` / `computed` reactive state; `render(v, el)` client render.
- `notFound()` / `redirect(url[, status])` control-flow throws (page/layout/action only, NOT `route.ts`). `forbidden()` / `unauthorized()` render the nearest boundary.
- `Suspense({fallback, children})` page-level streaming; `<webjs-suspense>` component-level streaming.
- `optimistic()` optimistic UI; `navigate(url)` / `revalidate(url?)` client-router control; `connectWS` / `richFetch`.
- Types: `Metadata`, `PageProps<R>`, `LayoutProps<R>`, `RouteHandlerContext<R>`, `WebjsConfig`.
- `@webjsdev/core/server`: `renderToString` / `renderToStream` (Node side).
- `@webjsdev/core/directives`: `repeat`, `unsafeHTML` (trusted only), `live`, `keyed`, `guard`, `cache`, `until`, `watch(signal)`, `ref` / `createRef`. `Task` lives at `@webjsdev/core/task`, context at `/context`.

### `@webjsdev/server` (server side)

- `createRequestHandler`, `cors()`, `route(action, opts?)` REST adapter, `sitemap()` / `sitemapIndex()`, `actionContext()`, `actionSignal()`, `requestId()`, `cache()` / `revalidateTag`.
- Data layer is Drizzle in `db/*.server.ts`. Auth, sessions, caching, rate limit, file storage are built in and pluggable (`references/built-ins.md`).

### File conventions

`page.ts` (server-only fn), `layout.ts` (embeds `children`), `route.ts` (HTTP handler), `middleware.ts`, `*.server.ts` (server boundary), `error.ts` / `loading.ts` / `not-found.ts` / `forbidden.ts` / `unauthorized.ts` (boundaries), metadata routes (`sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, `manifest.ts`, `icon.ts`, `opengraph-image.ts`).

## Canonical Patterns

### A page

```ts
// app/about/page.ts
import { html } from '@webjsdev/core';
export default function About() {
  return html`<h1>About</h1>`;
}
```

### A dynamic route reading data through an action

```ts
// app/users/[id]/page.ts
import { html } from '@webjsdev/core';
import { getUser } from '#modules/users/queries/get-user.server.ts';
export default async function User({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const user = await getUser(params.id); // never import the DB directly into a page
  return html`<h1>${user.name}</h1>`;
}
```

### A server action

```ts
// modules/users/actions/update-profile.server.ts
'use server';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { db } from '#db/connection.server.ts';
import { users } from '#db/schema.server.ts';
export async function updateProfile(input: { id: string; name: string }) {
  const name = String(input?.name || '').trim();
  if (!name) return { success: false, error: 'name required', status: 400 };
  const [row] = await db.update(users).set({ name }).where(eq(users.id, input.id)).returning();
  return { success: true, data: row };
}
```

Call it from a component via a normal import (rewritten to a typed RPC stub). Never hand-write `fetch()`.

### An interactive component

```ts
// components/counter.ts
import { WebComponent, prop, html } from '@webjsdev/core';
class Counter extends WebComponent({ count: prop(Number) }) {
  constructor() { super(); this.count = 0; }
  render() {
    return html`<button @click=${() => this.count++}>${this.count}</button>`;
  }
}
Counter.register('my-counter');
```

### The no-JS write path (a page action)

```ts
// app/contact/page.ts
export const action = async ({ formData }) => {
  const email = String(formData.get('email') || '');
  if (!email) return { success: false, fieldErrors: { email: 'required' } };
  return { success: true, redirect: '/thanks' };
};
export default function Contact({ actionData }) { /* render form + actionData errors */ }
```

Success is a 303 (PRG); failure re-renders the page at 422 with the result on `actionData`. With JS the client router applies the response in place.

## Security And Session Defaults

- Never ship demo secrets. Require session and provider secrets from the environment and fail fast if missing.
- Action RPC CSRF is an Origin / `Sec-Fetch-Site` check, not a token cookie. A safe GET action is CSRF-exempt. A `route.ts` REST endpoint is NOT covered: authenticate every mutating endpoint, validate, rate-limit.
- Prod action errors are sanitized to a generic message plus a digest. Put a user-facing message on the `ActionResult` `{ success: false, error }` envelope, never on a raw throw.
- Use `forbidden()` for an authenticated user lacking permission, `unauthorized()` for an unauthenticated request. Inside a `'use server'` RPC action, return an `ActionResult` for an auth failure instead of throwing.
- For CORS use `cors()` from `@webjsdev/server`; `credentials: true` REQUIRES an explicit origin allowlist, never `'*'`.

## Testing Defaults

- Prefer server/handler tests first: drive the app with `handle()` from `@webjsdev/server/testing` and assert on the `Response`.
- Add a browser test (`webjs test --browser`) for anything touching hydration, the client router, slots, or custom-element upgrade. A unit test is necessary but NOT sufficient for a browser-facing change.
- Render the app and LOOK for any UI change: `webjs check` and `webjs typecheck` pass even when a layout collapses. Static tools give no signal for a visual defect.
- WebJs runs on Node 24+ AND Bun. Prove a runtime-sensitive change (serializer, listener, streams, `node:crypto`, the TS stripper) on both.

## Common Mistakes To Avoid

- Treating a page or layout like a React component and expecting its markup to hydrate. It runs server-only; put interactivity in a component.
- Importing a `.server.ts` utility (no `'use server'`) directly into a shipping component. Its browser stub throws at load; reach it through a `'use server'` action.
- Using a `static properties` block or a class-field initializer for reactive props instead of the `WebComponent({ ... })` factory.
- Quoting an event / property / boolean hole (`@click="${fn}"`).
- Writing `fetch()` to call your own server instead of importing the action.
- Throwing `redirect()` / `notFound()` inside a `route.ts` handler (uncaught 500). Return a `Response` there.
- A placeholder first paint that fetches in `connectedCallback`. SSR does not call `connectedCallback`; put first-paint data in the constructor (server-known inputs) or use `async render()`.
- A browser global (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`) in the constructor or `render()`. It throws at SSR; do browser-only work in `connectedCallback`.
- Interpolating into a component's `<style>` / `<script>` body. Use `static styles` or Tailwind.
