name: webjs-list-todos
description: Use this skill when the user asks what work is open or pending on the webjsdev/webjs project board. Trigger phrases include "what are the current todo items", "what's pending", "list todos", "what's open", "what should I work on", "show me the open issues", "any open work for webjs", "what's in progress", "what's on the board", or any natural-language query about open items on the webjs project at https://github.com/orgs/webjsdev/projects/1. The skill calls `gh project item-list` and returns a bucketed view (Todo / In progress / Done) so the user sees the current state straight from the source of truth.
when_to_use: |
  Examples that should trigger this skill:
    "what are the current todo items"
    "what's pending"
    "list webjs todos"
    "what should I work on next"
    "show me the open issues"
    "any open work on the webjs board"
    "what's in progress right now"
  Do NOT trigger for: starting work on a specific issue (webjs-start-work handles that), filing a new task (webjs-file-issue handles that), or asking about closed/done items only (those are queryable but not the primary intent of this skill).

# List open work on the webjs project board

The webjsdev/webjs project tracks work on the GitHub Project at https://github.com/orgs/webjsdev/projects/1. This skill returns a current snapshot bucketed by Status, queried straight from GitHub. Do NOT consult internal task trackers or memory for this question.

## Steps

1. **Fetch the board state.**

   ```sh
   gh project item-list 1 --owner webjsdev --format json
   ```

2. **Bucket by Status** (Todo, In progress, Done) and pretty-print each bucket with issue numbers and titles. If the user explicitly asked for only one bucket (e.g. "what's in progress"), filter accordingly.

3. **Default presentation.** Show Todo and In progress always. Show Done only if the user asks for it, or if both Todo and In progress are empty.

4. **For each item, show:** `#<number>  <title>`. Wrap in markdown so the user can click through.

## Example output shape

```
Todo:
  #112  Elide browser download of display-only component modules
  #113  Ship pre-built dist/ alongside src/ for @webjsdev/core
  #114  Rate-limit defaultKey trusts unverified X-Forwarded-For

In progress:
  (none)
```

If everything is in Done or the board is empty, say so explicitly.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not move cards, file new issues, or open PRs. Those are sibling skills (`webjs-start-work`, `webjs-file-issue`).
- Does not show closed issues outside the project board.
- Does not consult `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/` or any internal task tracker.

## Failure handling

- If `gh` returns an auth error: surface it directly to the user and suggest `gh auth refresh -s project`.
- If the project list is empty: report "Project board is empty" instead of fabricating items.
