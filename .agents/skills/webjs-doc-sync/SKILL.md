name: webjs-doc-sync
description: Use this skill whenever a change ships a user-facing or agent-facing surface (a new export, CLI flag, package.json webjs.* config key, html hole prefix, lifecycle hook, convention, or a behaviour change to an already-documented feature) and the docs must be brought in sync, OR when the user asks to find documentation drift / doc gaps / "did we update the docs", audit shipped work for missing docs, or sync the docs surfaces. The skill carries the authoritative map of EVERY doc surface webjs ships and the change-type to surface mapping, so no surface (the docs site, the marketing website, agent-docs, README, AGENTS.md, the scaffold templates' per-agent rule files) is silently skipped.
when_to_use: |
  Examples that should trigger this skill:
    "we added HTTP verbs for server actions but never updated the docs"
    "sync the docs for the new path-alias feature"
    "find all the doc gaps from recently shipped work"
    "did we update the docs site and website for this?"
    "audit the Done issues for missing documentation"
    finishing any feature whose public/agent-facing surface changed
  Do NOT trigger for: a pure-internal change with no public surface (a
  refactor, CI wiring, a release bump, test stabilization, a perf change
  that does not alter behaviour). Those need no doc update.

# Keep every webjs doc surface in sync with shipped behaviour

webjs ships its documentation across SEVERAL independent surfaces. The recurring
failure mode is updating ONE (usually `AGENTS.md`) and silently missing the rest,
so the docs site, the marketing website, and the scaffold's per-agent rule files
drift behind the framework. HTTP-verb server actions (#488) shipped with
`AGENTS.md` updated but the docs site untouched, which is exactly the gap this
skill exists to close.

This skill is the authoritative map of every surface plus a deterministic
change-type to surface mapping. Use it in two modes: **per-change sync** (a
feature just shipped, bring docs in line) and **audit** (sweep already-shipped
work for drift and file follow-ups).

## The complete doc surface map

Treat this list as the universe. For any change, decide per surface whether it
applies, then update or consciously skip each.

1. **`AGENTS.md`** (repo root) plus **`agent-docs/*.md`** (the 12 deep-reference
   files: `metadata`, `components`, `styling`, `built-ins`, `configuration`,
   `advanced`, `typescript`, `service-worker`, `testing`, `framework-dev`,
   `recipes`, `lit-muscle-memory-gotchas`). `AGENTS.md` stays lean and points at
   the matching `agent-docs/<x>.md` for the full reference. A new public API goes
   in BOTH the `AGENTS.md` summary and the relevant `agent-docs` file.
2. **`README.md`** (repo root). Update when a headline capability changes (the
   feature list, the quickstart, the runtime/template matrix).
3. **The docs site: `docs/app/docs/<topic>/page.tsx`.** This is the
   user-facing documentation at docs.webjs.dev. Find the topic page(s) that cover
   the area (`server-actions`, `routing`, `components`, `caching`, `configuration`,
   `client-router`, `data-fetching`, ...) and update them. `llms.txt` /
   `llms-full.txt` are generated LIVE from the doc pages (no build step), so they
   never need a manual edit. A brand-new capability may need a NEW topic page plus
   a nav entry.
4. **The marketing website: `website/`.** Update landing/feature copy when a
   headline capability changes. The changelog (`website/app/changelog`) is
   auto-generated from conventional PR titles, so NEVER hand-write it; the blog is
   manual.
5. **The scaffold templates: `packages/cli/templates/`.** Every new app ships
   these, so a change to how apps are AUTHORED must propagate here:
   `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `.cursorrules`,
   `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.agents/rules/workflow.md`, and the
   `.gemini` / `.opencode` / `.claude` rule files. These per-agent files all carry
   the SAME rules in each agent's format; a workflow/convention change must land in
   ALL of them in lockstep (the #134 / #136 divergence lesson). The CLI help text
   in `packages/cli/` is part of this surface for a new command or flag.
6. **Example / dogfood apps** (`examples/blog/CONVENTIONS.md` and friends). Update
   when a convention the example demonstrates changes.

## Change-type to surface mapping

| Change | Surfaces that MUST be checked |
|---|---|
| New / changed public export (`@webjsdev/core` or `/server`), `html` hole prefix, lifecycle hook | AGENTS.md + matching `agent-docs/*.md` + docs site topic page + README if headline |
| New / changed CLI command or flag | AGENTS.md CLI reference + docs site page + README + the CLI `--help` text in `packages/cli/` |
| New `package.json` `webjs.*` config key | AGENTS.md configuration section + `agent-docs/configuration.md` + docs site `configuration` page + `WebjsConfig` type + the JSON Schema |
| New convention or agent workflow rule | AGENTS.md + repo `CONVENTIONS.md` (if added) + ALL scaffold per-agent rule files in lockstep + `agent-docs` if relevant |
| Behaviour change to an already-documented feature | EVERY surface that describes the old behaviour (grep the feature's tokens across all surfaces below) |
| New file convention (`*.server.ts`, a routing file) | AGENTS.md file-conventions + docs site `routing` / relevant page + scaffold templates |
| Pure internal (refactor, CI, release, test, perf with no behaviour change) | NONE. Consciously record that no doc surface applies. |

## Per-change sync procedure

1. Identify the change's IDENTIFYING TOKENS: the export name, CLI flag, config
   key, file-convention string, or feature phrase a doc would mention.
2. Grep those tokens across every surface to see where the feature is (or should
   be) described:
   ```sh
   git grep -n -iE '<token1>|<token2>' -- \
     AGENTS.md 'agent-docs/**' README.md 'docs/app/docs/**' \
     'website/**' 'packages/cli/templates/**' 'examples/**/CONVENTIONS.md'
   ```
3. For each surface in the mapping that applies, update it. For a behaviour
   CHANGE, every place the OLD behaviour is described must be corrected (the grep
   surfaces them).
4. Verify: re-run the grep and confirm each applicable surface now describes the
   new behaviour, and no surface still describes the old one.
5. Respect the prose-punctuation invariant (#11) and run `webjs check` if any
   code-shaped doc (a `.tsx` doc page) changed.

## Audit-mode procedure (sweep shipped work for drift)

Use this to find existing gaps (for example, across the Done items on the project
board):

1. Build the candidate list: the shipped changes whose surface is user-facing or
   agent-facing (`feat:` / behaviour-changing `fix:` / new CLI / new config /
   new convention). Skip pure-internal items (CI, release, refactor, test
   stabilization, perf-only).
2. For each candidate, read what it introduced (the issue body / merged PR), pull
   its identifying tokens, and run the surface grep above.
3. A surface is a GAP when the mapping says it applies but the grep finds the
   feature absent (or describing stale behaviour) there. A feature documented only
   in `AGENTS.md` with a docs-site topic page that never mentions it is the
   canonical gap.
4. For each confirmed gap, file a grounded follow-up via the **webjs-file-issue**
   skill (title `docs: <surface> missing <feature>`, body naming the exact files
   to edit and the source of truth to copy from). Do not fix silently without a
   tracked issue when auditing in bulk; the issue is the unit of work.
5. Then implement the fixes (each its own logical commit, `docs:` prefix for the
   changelog), syncing ALL applicable surfaces per the per-change procedure.

## What this skill does NOT do

- It does not regenerate `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` (those are live-generated).
- It does not hand-write the website changelog (auto from PR titles).
- It does not decide whether a change is internal; that judgement is step 1, and
  a genuinely internal change correctly updates no doc surface.
