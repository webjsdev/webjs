 * projects, because the name is genuinely contested: a dormant Java framework,
 * a small client-side toolkit, and whatsapp-web.js all answer to some spelling
 * of it. A `sameAs` array is the explicit statement that resolves them.
 *
 * Every JSON-LD node that identifies the PROJECT imports THIS array, so no
 * two of them can drift apart. That is the Organization and the
 * SoftwareApplication on the home page plus the SoftwareApplication on
 * /what-is-webjs, and any later one, since the test derives the carriers from
 * what is rendered rather than from a list. The WebSite node is not one of
 * them: it describes this site as a document collection, not the project.
 *
 * Only list a property that resolves and is project-controlled. A dead URL in
 * `sameAs` is a negative signal, so a shorter verified list beats a longer
 * aspirational one. Every entry below was probed before being added.
