/**
 * Heading extraction for the docs search index (app/api/search/route.ts).
 *
 * `lib/docs-llms.server.ts` renders each doc page to markdown, turning
 * <h1> through <h4> into leading-hash lines and wrapping every code sample
 * in a ``` fence. Recovering the headings is therefore a line scan, with
 * one rule that is easy to miss: a docs sample routinely opens a line with
 * `# ` (a shell comment) or `#field` (a JS private class field), and a scan
 * with no fence tracking scores those as section titles. Fifty-three of
 * them were indexed across nine pages before this existed, which is how a
 * query for `localhost` once ranked /docs/backend-only at 16.
 *
 * The fence predicate is byte-identical to the one bodyToMarkdown runs in
 * its normalisation pass (lib/docs-llms.server.ts). It is a hand-kept
 * duplicate rather than a shared import, because this file stays a pure
 * browser-safe helper with no imports and that module is server-only. Two
 * passes over the same corpus that disagreed about where a fence starts
 * would drift silently, so `test/lib/doc-headings.test.ts` pins the two
 * copies equal: change one and it reds.
