/**
 * The brand marks.
 *
 * The drawing is the original Velocity lockup. As of the design-review round
 * the wordmark is OUTLINED PATHS (2.8 KB per variant), generated from the
 * authored geometry with the embedded face instanced at weight 900, so the
 * files no longer carry a 56 KB font and render identically in browsers,
 * markdown viewers, and design tools. Regenerate via
 * scratchpad fonttool/outline-lockup.cjs if the drawing ever changes.
 *
 * Each variant is a separate file rather than one CSS-inverted image because
 * inverting flips the paper along with the ink. Both <img>s carry explicit
 * width/height so the header composes before any fetch, and at ~3 KB each the
 * hidden variant's download is noise.

// Paths, not resolved urls. `asset()` is called at RENDER time below, never at
// module scope. The reason is not resolver ordering (the server installs its
// resolver at boot, before any app module loads, so a module-scope call would
// in fact resolve): a depth-0 call is a module-scope SIDE EFFECT, and the
// elision analyser treats that as client work, which pins the whole importing
// page or layout into the browser bundle. Hoisting the constant here would
// therefore ship this module and its importer for no benefit. Calling inside
// the template keeps the module inert and costs a memoized lookup.

 * light one: it inverts the paper as well as the ink, so the mark stops sitting
 * on the page background.
