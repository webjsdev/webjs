/**
 * The two framework-source windows, VERBATIM from the packages that ship to
 * every app's node_modules. Contiguous, unedited, de-indented only. That
 * fidelity is the argument the section makes, so a reworded excerpt would be
 * a claim ABOUT readable source rather than a sample of it. Re-derive them
 * from the files rather than hand-editing here.
 *
 * Both were chosen against three constraints:
 *   1. The comment explains WHY, not what. That is the half a build step
 *      destroys and the half an agent needs.
 *   2. No backtick anywhere, per invariant 9, which rules out most of the
 *      codebase's JSDoc.
 *   3. Code-dominant. The first core pick was 5 comment lines to 4 of code
 *      and read as documentation rather than as the source that runs, which
 *      is the opposite of the point. Aim for 3 comment to 7 code or better.
 *      That pick also STARTED MID-SENTENCE, because its comment opened two
 *      lines earlier on a line containing backticks. Check that an excerpt
 *      begins where its comment does.
 *   4. At most 69 columns. Real source runs to 78 at p90, and a two-up card
 *      at the 1152px grid holds 74 at 12px, so most of the codebase simply
 *      does not fit beside itself. Check the width before swapping either.
