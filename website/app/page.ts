//   shape             stays. pays off the hero's first half
//   framework         and when the demos and the skill run out, the framework
//   source            itself is readable, in this app's own node_modules
//   works without     the backend template is the option nobody expects, and
//   a UI too          it is what converts a reader who thinks this is UI-only.
//                     NOT "Start where you are": that collided with the CTA
//                     heading "Start building with AI" directly below it.
//
// Rewriting a lede in isolation is what breaks this: the hand-off is in the
// FIRST sentence of each, so a lede that opens on its own section's topic
// leaves the page reading as a spec sheet again. Move a section and the two
// ledes on either side of the seam have to move with it.
//
// EVERY SECTION MUST STAND ALONE. This outranks the hand-off above whenever the
// two conflict. Readers arrive mid-page from a search result or a shared link,
// so a header and its opening sentence have to resolve with nothing above them.
// Test it by reading the header plus the first sentence with everything above
// covered. Four failed that test at once and every failure was a backward
// reference: "That first paint" (which paint?), "By the time the demos go"
// (what demos?), "All of it arrives" (all of what?), and the header "Your agent
// reaches before it writes" (reaches where?).
//
// PROTECTIVE repetition is allowed. The anti-repetition rule below is about
// re-making an ARGUMENT, which is waste, and that is why two bento cards were
// deleted for restating whole sections. It does NOT cover a line that stops a
// fast scroller forming a wrong impression from the section they landed on.
// "It works without a UI too" therefore repeats two things on purpose: that the app
// arrives with demos AND that one command clears them, and that the defaults
// are swappable. Someone who lands there cold and reads only "you get a working
// app full of demos" bounces, and the fix for that is not upstream prose they
// did not read. Cut an echo when missing it costs the reader nothing. Keep it
// when missing it costs them the wrong idea.
//
// A sequential reader loses nothing, because a self-contained opening still
// echoes the section above it. "The file in your editor and the file in the
// network tab are the same file" reads as the next step if you came from "The
// first paint is the whole page" and as a plain claim if you did not. Get both,
// do not trade one for the other.
//
// But a hand-off must not be BOUGHT with a false claim, which is how that lede
// read for a long time: "A first paint is only honest if what you wrote is what
// shipped." It chains beautifully off the section above and it is not true.
// Whether the first paint is complete and whether the shipped bytes match your
// source are unrelated properties, and a Rails or PHP app with a bundled
// frontend has a perfectly honest first paint. A reader who thinks about the
// sentence for one second catches it, which is the worst possible place to lose
// them: the section directly below is the one asking to be trusted. State the
// section's own claim plainly and let the sequence be a bonus.
//
// A lede may hand BACK to the section above, but it must NAME what it is
// handing back to. A bare pronoun cannot survive the trip, because a large
// heading sits between the pronoun and its referent and steals the antecedent.
// "That first paint arrives..." works, since it names the thing. Three ledes
// once did not and all three read as broken:
//
//   "Everything below falls out of that one decision"  which decision?
//   "All of that only helps if the agent finds it"     all of what?
//   "That is true of your code"                        read as referring to the
//                                                      header directly above it,
//                                                      which INVERTED the meaning
//
// Name it, or open on something self-contained. Do not write "as the previous
// section showed" either: that is documentation voice and it makes the reader
// do bookkeeping.
//
// The trap is easy to fall into WHILE FIXING one of these. The replacement for
// the third was "When it needs to go deeper than that, it can", which is the
// same defect wearing different words. If your fix still contains a bare
// "that", "this", "the above", or a comparative with no stated baseline, it is
// not fixed. Read the first sentence with the heading covering everything above
// it: if it still resolves, it is done.
//
// The HEADERS carry their own rule, learned by getting it wrong twice. Each is
// a self-contained CLAIM, never a label for the contents and never a pointer at
// something the reader has not read yet. "Modern full-stack, on web standards"
// was the label version, and "It all falls out of one decision" was the pointer
// version, which fails because a reader cannot resolve WHICH decision from the
// header alone. The consequence link belongs in the lede's first sentence,
// where there is room to name what it refers back to.

// The one surviving measured number, rendered under the bento. It was a
// four-stat grid in its own section; three of those stats restated sections
// above them and the section resisted every header it was given, so it went.
// This one stays because it answers the objection the bento raises, which is
// that a framework with everything in it must be heavy.
//
// MEASURE BEFORE EDITING. It has been stale once, at ~29 KB, which made the
// derived multiplier wrong too:
//   curl -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip' -o /dev/null -w '%{size_download}' \
//     https://webjs.dev/__webjs/core/dist/webjs-core-browser.js
// The importmap points @webjsdev/core at that exact file, so it is what a
// visitor pays, and it INCLUDES the client router that index-browser.js
// side-effect-imports. The ~99 KB Next baseline is the full one (react +
// react-dom + the Next runtime + the app-router client).

// The interactive component / server action / page samples live in
// #lib/samples.ts and render through codeWindow() in "Show, don't tell".

// Chips for the progressive-enhancement section: the concrete things that
// keep working with JavaScript disabled, because the server sends real HTML.
// The chips run in the order the section argues: what a component IS, then
// what the browser does with it, then what that buys. The last two are the
// progressive-enhancement and elision claims, which the section keeps even
// though its heading no longer leads with them, because they are consequences
// of the component model rather than a separate topic, and the P.S. dare below
// invites the reader to check the fourth one in their own browser.
//
// 'No whole-page hydration' is the precise form and the ONLY one to use here.
// WebJs does hydrate: a shipping component loads @webjsdev/core, and
// createInstance() in render-client.js does container.replaceChildren(...),
// which discards the server's DOM and rebuilds from the compiled template.
// What is absent is the whole-tree walk. Hydration is scheduled per element by
// the browser's own custom-element upgrade, pages and layouts never hydrate at
// all, and elided components never ship. Anything shorter ("no hydration
// runtime", "no hydration overhead") reads as zero cost and is refuted by one
// look at the network tab.

        <!-- Same clamp curve as --text-display but with the ceiling lowered from
             5.5rem to 4.5rem, and a max-width in REM rather than ch. Both are
             deliberate. This headline is 59 characters where the token was tuned
             for 31, and at 5.5rem its first sentence alone ran 1222px inside a
             1464px container, so the line broke mid-second-sentence and the
             headline sprawled edge to edge. 4.5rem with 62rem breaks it exactly
             at the full stop, one claim per line. 64rem is 1024px against a measured
             1008.66px first sentence, so the margin is 15px. Measure an UNWRAPPED
             clone: summing a Range getClientRects() over already-wrapped text
             sums the line fragments and gives the wrong number.

             The max-width MUST NOT be in ch. A previous attempt used max-w-[32ch]
             which computes to 1918px at this font size, wider than the container,
             so it constrained nothing at all. ch scales with the font, which is
             the whole trap.

             NO text-balance here either, for the same reason. Balancing splits
             the headline into evenly weighted lines, which produced three lines
             breaking mid-word ("Conventions your agent f") even though the first
             sentence fits its line with 13px to spare. The max-width IS the line
             break, so greedy filling is what we want. -->
        <!-- The clamp FLOOR is the thing to be careful with, not the max. It was
             2.9rem (46.4px), which the preferred term reaches at a 476px viewport,
             so every phone rendered the identical 46.4px and the size stopped
             responding exactly where it mattered: 58 characters at 46.4px in a
             342px box is 5 ragged lines and a 237px-tall headline. The floor is
             now 1.5rem, reached only below 282px, so the size is genuinely fluid
             across every real device.

             The headline carries a HARD break between its two sentences, and
             the slope is solved backwards from what that break costs. A break
             is free at 768 and above, where each sentence fits its own line
             anyway. On a phone it is not free: at 34px the two sentences take
             four lines with two orphans ("follows." at 103px, "own." at 70px).
             At 30px they take three (232/183/337), the same count the inline
             version needed, with the sentence boundary respected instead of
             straddling line two. So 30px at 390px is the constraint the whole
             curve is fitted to, and it still reaches the 66px cap at ~1044px.

             text-balance is safe on the H1 ONLY because of that break. Without
             it, balance rearranged both sentences together and at 768 shortened
             the H1 to 547/475/295, which made the subtitle measure 119% of the
             title, wider than the thing it sits under. With the break, balance
             can only even the lines WITHIN a sentence, which is what turns
             312/103/337 into 232/183/337 on a phone and changes nothing above
             it. Do not remove the break and keep the balance.

             Below about 360px it goes to four lines, which is correct: a 320px
             phone cannot hold this headline in three without type too small to
             lead a page.

             Measured 26.1 / 29.9 / 50.7 / 66px at 320 / 390 / 768 / 1280, with
             the H1 at 4 / 3 / 2 / 2 lines and the subtitle at 91-92% of the
             title's longest line from 768 up. Re-measure all of them before
             touching any of the three numbers; they are chosen against the wrap
             points, not picked. -->

        <!-- Two sentences. The second one is the PAGE'S THESIS, and it took a
             long time to find because it is not any single section's claim.

             Read the six sections as one argument and five of them are the
             same claim about a different layer: the browser is not kept
             waiting (first paint), a build does not stand between your file
             and the wire (nothing compiled away), the scaffold is readable
             rather than magic (the app has a shape), the framework itself is
             openable (source in your project), and the same holds with no
             frontend at all (works without a UI). The through line is that
             nothing is concealed, at any layer. That is what the subtitle now
             says, so every section below is evidence for it rather than a new
             topic.

             It ends on "you" deliberately. The H1's second half is about
             ownership, and the comma before "or from you" echoes it without
             restating it.

             What came out, and why each looked like a loss until it was not:

             "What your agent writes reaches the browser line for line, so it
             debugs real code and you read exactly what runs" is what "Nothing
             is compiled away" proves two sections down with two code windows.
             A demonstrated claim beats a stated one; stating it here spends
             the reveal.

             "Conventions guide the first prompt to production-ready code, so
             fewer tokens go to plumbing" gave the mechanism rather than the
             outcome, and token economy was the page's only mention of tokens.
             Rails leads with token efficiency and can afford to, because its
             subtitle never has to say what Rails is. Half of this one does,
             which is the tax an unrecognised name pays.

             An ownership clause was drafted twice ("everything it writes stays
             yours to read and change") and cut twice: the H1 says it already.

             "Built for agents from the ground up while providing excellent DX
             for humans" was proposed and declined: it restates the H1, "DX"
             cannot be checked, and it sets at 923px in an 848px box.

             "Your agent starts working on your feature, not the scaffolding"
             was the last version before this one. Accurate, checkable, and
             narrower than the page: it described the scaffold section only.

             Do not elaborate this. A third sentence has been tried four times
             and every one turned out to be some section's claim said weaker.
             The six sections ARE the elaboration.

             Line breaking is the BROWSER'S job here, not ours. text-balance on
             the subtitle, no hand-placed break, and the same 64rem box the H1
             uses. This is the rubyonrails.org model, read off their live CSS:
             text-wrap: balance on the hero copy, no br anywhere, and no
             max-width of its own.

             It replaced a hand-tuned system (a br, a 53rem box solved against
             the title's longest line, and a type cap derived from it) that took
             six rounds to converge and broke whenever a word changed. What
             balance buys, measured:

               390px   4 ragged lines (341/262/326/83, an 83px orphan)
                       becomes 3 even ones (342/336/341)
               1280px  842/575 becomes 841/842

             The subtitle reads narrower than the title WITHOUT a narrower box,
             which is the part worth understanding: it has more text, so balance
             spreads it into even lines while the H1 fills its measure. 91% of
             the title's longest line at 1280.

             The H1 does NOT get text-balance, and that is deliberate. Adding it
             shortened the H1's lines at 768 (547/475/295 instead of
             547/655/115) and the subtitle then measured 119% of the title, wider
             than the thing it sits under. Balance is right for the element with
             more text and wrong for the one with less.

             Sizes are two tokens now, --text-hero-lede and --text-lede, because
             a hero subtitle wants to be half the headline and a page lede wants
             to be readable at six lines. They were fighting over one number.

             Measured 18.5 / 23.6 / 30.4px at 390 / 768 / 1280, install bar above
             the fold at 499 of 844 on a phone (was 547, the tighter H1 leading
             bought that back).

          <!-- THE RULE FOR THIS LEDE, kept from the version before it: claim
               nothing about another framework, and nothing that needs a footnote
               about which configuration you are in. It was learned the hard way.
               An earlier 106-word draft made three claims about frameworks in
               general and not one survived being checked against the Next source
               sitting on this machine.
                 "The runtime has to load, parse, and hydrate before the page can
               be read at all" is false: Next server-renders client components too
               (use-flight-response.tsx feeds the Flight stream through
               createFromReadableStream with an ssrModuleMapping, and next/dynamic
               defaults to ssr: true), so its HTML reads immediately.
                 "Every page pays for the runtime" is true of the App Router, whose
               getRequiredScripts throws an invariant on an empty script list, and
               false of the Pages Router, which has unstable_runtimeJS: false.
                 "A page with nothing interactive ships none at all" is true of
               this framework (ssr.js emits no <script> when moduleUrls is empty)
               and describes a case almost no app reaches, since one interactive
               component in the root layout puts every page under it back on the
               runtime. This website is the proof: all five routes ship core,
               because the layout renders theme-toggle and site-nav-menu.
                 The chips below enumerate, the P.S. below runs the comparison in
               the reader's own browser, and the prose only has to be true.

               THE DX CLAIM IS MADE IN NOUNS, never as a comparison. "Better DX"
               in the heading is the promise; the lede has to pay it with things
               a reader can check in the stage below, which is why it names
               reactive properties in the class signature, signals, a tagged
               template literal for markup, and the absence of a decorator or a
               build step. The template syntax IS lit's, and the comment down by
               the familiarity argument says so, but this lede does not name it:
               a reader who knows lit does not need telling here, and one who
               does not reads a dependency the framework does not have. Do not
               cash it as
               "less boilerplate" or "better than X": the first needs a baseline
               the page never states and the second breaks the rule above. The
               stage is the evidence, so keep the lede naming what HERO_SAMPLE
               visibly does.

               "Nothing sits between your class and the DOM it renders" is about
               the RENDER PATH, not about shipped bytes: core is on the page for
               any shipping component. Do not upgrade it to "no runtime", which
               one look at the network tab refutes.

               The term "progressive enhancement" still comes LAST, after the
               concrete behaviours, and it is the one label allowed in here. Put
               it first and a reader pattern-matches it to no-JS purism and skips
               the section, which is a constraint they think they know rather
               than a capability they can check. After the demonstration it is a
               handle for what they just read, plus the phrase they would search
               for. Keep it in the same paragraph as the WebJs mention for that
               reason: nothing else in the section names the project, and someone
               arriving from a search result needs to know whose page this is.

               The last sentence leads with the component being server-rendered,
               on purpose. An earlier draft said "what loads afterwards is only
               the components that are actually interactive", which says the
               MARKUP arrives late, the opposite of this section's claim. -->

          <p class="text-fg-muted text-base leading-[1.6] m-0">
            A component here is a real custom element. The browser owns
            registration, upgrade, and the lifecycle, so nothing sits between
            your class and the DOM it renders. What WebJs adds is the
            ergonomics. Reactive properties are declared in the class signature,
            state runs on signals, markup is a tagged template literal, and
            none of it needs a decorator or a build step. Every
            component is server-rendered first, so the page reads and its forms
            submit before a script runs, which makes progressive enhancement the
            default rather than an effort.
          </p>
          <!-- The dare belongs to THIS section, whose chips below enumerate the
               very things it invites you to check. It stays a dare by naming
               nobody: it asserts nothing about any other site, so it cannot go
               stale when somebody else redeploys, and it links nowhere, so it
               does not hand the page's highest-intent readers to a competitor.
               The pun carries the target.

               Everything it DOES claim about this page is true with JS off: the
               content reads, an <a> navigates, and the palette follows the OS
               because it is light-dark() in CSS rather than a class an inline
               script applies. What does NOT survive is an explicitly toggled
               theme, whose bootstrap script cannot run, and the live demos. That
               is why the sentence lists what works rather than claiming
               everything does. Keep it that way: the whole point of an
               invitation to go and check is that checking confirms it. -->
          <!-- 68ch, not the 62ch a measure-based default would pick. At 62ch the
               greedy fill left "mind" and the wink alone on a third line: the
               text sets solid at about 1078px, so two lines want 539px each and
               a 62ch box is 548px, close enough that the last words could not
               fit but not close enough to absorb them. Two lines start at 64ch
               (564px of a 566px box, flush against the edge), so 68ch is the
               first width with enough slack that a font substitution cannot push
               it back to three. Measures 601px wide with lines of 567 and 562 on
               a laptop. Re-measure if the sentence changes length: three lines
               here are not a wrapping bug, they are the last two words orphaned,
               which is the one paragraph on the page where a ragged tail
               undercuts the tone. Below about 650px of viewport it wraps further
               and that is correct. -->

          <!-- THE HEADING IS STRONGER THAN THE SECTION, deliberately, and the
               lede has to bring it back inside two carve-outs it does not state
               itself. "What you write is what runs" is true of the files that
               SHIP, and there are two ways a file is not one of them. The action
               window on the left never reaches the browser at all (invariant 1),
               which the lede covers with "the action becomes an RPC call". And
               an elided display-only component is not served either, which the
               chips in the section above claim and this section does not mention
               on purpose, since the reader has just read it. Do not widen the
               lede to "every file you write is served", which both of those
               refute, and do not answer the tension by softening the heading:
               it is the same sentence /why-webjs uses for its first reason card,
               so the two pages state the claim identically. Rename one and
               rename the other.

               The two windows below are NOT the same kind of file, and the lede
               must not say they are. It read "both served to the browser exactly
               as they sit on disk", which denies invariant 1: the action is a
               'use server' .server.ts, so it NEVER reaches the browser, and its
               import is rewritten to an RPC stub. The page does ship, with its
               types blanked to whitespace, so it is identical line for line and
               column for column rather than byte for byte. Saying so is also the
               better story, since the boundary is more interesting than the
               sameness. Check both windows against this sentence before editing
               either: the sample files decide what the sentence may claim.

               "Because there is no build step" is the section NAMING what it has
               spent four sentences demonstrating, the same demonstrate-then-name
               move the web-components lede above makes with progressive
               enhancement. It was missing: the phrase appeared twice on the whole page, both
               times in the hero, and the section that proves it said only
               "without a bundler", attributed to Rails. So a reader landing here
               cold got the evidence and never the name. It also rescues the Rails
               sentence, which reads as a non sequitur unless the paragraph has
               already made a build claim for "without a bundler" to echo.

               The lede does NOT make the type-safety point, on purpose. The
               "Call the server like a function" card two sections down already
               says the call site keeps the function's real argument and return
               types, and it has a client-to-server diagram beside it. A lede
               sentence here would be the same argument made twice, weaker, and
               without the picture. The sentence that used to sit here ("the
               types cross with the import...") was also carrying a claim that
               does not survive checking: codegen-free typing across the
               client / server boundary is what Next server actions and tRPC
               both already do, so "nothing is generated in between" describes
               the field rather than distinguishing this framework from it.

               "Typed RPC call" was likewise cut from the sentence above. Every
               clause around it is about what reaches the BROWSER, where the
               types are already whitespace, so "typed" there reads as if type
               information rides the wire. AGENTS.md says "typed RPC stub" and
               means typed at author time, which is right for a reference doc
               and misleading in a sentence whose subject is what ships. -->

          <p class="text-fg-muted text-base leading-[1.6] m-0">The file in your editor and the file in the browser network tab are the same file. Here is a server action and the page that calls it. The page ships as you see it, because there is no build step. TypeScript is stripped to whitespace rather than compiled, so a stack trace points at the line you wrote. The action becomes an RPC call. Rails has shipped its default frontend without a bundler since Rails 7 in 2021, so the approach has production miles behind it.</p>

          <!-- The lede opened with "Everything below falls out of the decision to
               skip the build step" and that was false of nearly every card, then
               and now. Architecture, types, auth, and the caching / rate-limit /
               storage / WebSocket set all exist in frameworks that DO build; only
               elision has even a weak link, being per-module because there is no
               bundler to tree-shake instead. It also fought the header, which
               promises the cards are what the BROWSER does not give you, so a
               reader hunting the build-step connection in "Auth is not a side
               quest" found nothing. The organising principle is the header's, not
               the build step's. Do not reintroduce a causal frame here: check any
               new opener against all six cards first. -->

               CLAIM that makes a scroller stop, the body is the payoff, and the
               inset carries the concrete noun so the grid still SKIMS. A reader
               who never reads a body should still be able to tell from the six
               insets that routing, data, auth, and the rest are covered, because
               that is why the architecture inset carries a route path and a
               .server file rather than prose, and why the type-safety one shows
               a row type reaching a template. Nothing else on the grid names
               them any more.
               "is this framework complete?" is the objection this grid exists to
               answer and no other section on the page answers it.

               "Zero build step" was deleted from this grid and should not come
               back: it restated "What you write is what runs", a section the
               reader has just finished, and it contradicted this section's header, which
               promises the cards are what the BROWSER does not give you.

               "Progressive enhancement" was deleted for the same reason and
               should stay out: the web-components section above this grid ends
               on it, and the P.S. dare there invites the reader to check it.

               The first four cards are the model-agnosticism, architecture,
               design-system and type-safety claims from /why-webjs, which is
               where each is argued at length. They are here because this grid
               answers "is this complete", and what a reader gets WITHOUT asking
               is the strongest answer to it. Keep the two pages saying the same
               thing: if the wording moves there, move it here too.

               Model-agnosticism leads because it is the reason to try this
               framework at all, and the rest of the grid is what you find once
               you have. It is a claim about LOCATION rather than about volume:
               the source is in the working directory the agent is already in,
               at the version installed, so a model reads it instead of recalling
               it. Do not restate it as "the source is open", which is true of
               every framework and argues nothing.

               Know what this grid no longer covers, because nothing else on the
               page covers it either. ELISION lost this slot: the chips under
               the web-components section above still assert it ("Display
               components ship 0 KB") but nothing explains it any more, and it is
               the one claim here no other framework can make. STREAMING is down
               to a word in the scaffold inventory near the bottom. The CLIENT
               ROUTER is claimed nowhere on the landing page at all. If a slot
               ever frees up, this is the note that says which to bring back. -->

             where it read "Familiar from day one. WebJs uses Next.js-style
             file-based routing and lit-style web components". It is an adoption
             lever (your existing knowledge transfers, so trying this costs
             less) and nothing else on the page makes it.

             Stated as restraint rather than as a disclaimer. "WebJs is not
             trying to be unique" says the same thing and reads as an apology;
             "invents as little as possible" is the same restraint offered as a
             deliberate choice. Both halves are accurate: routing is the Next.js
             app/ tree, and the component API matches lit with reactive
             properties as the one documented divergence, which is why this says
             "as little as possible" rather than "nothing".

             Kept to TWO lines at max-w-3xl on a laptop, which is what the length
             is tuned to. It was three, with "what your agent was trained on"
             orphaned on the last one. The text sets solid at 1728px against a
             768px box, so two lines want 864px each and roughly 30 characters
             had to go: "the Next.js file conventions" lost its article,
             "everything under them is the platform" became "the rest is the
             platform", and the two transfer clauses merged into one. Measures
             751 and 729 with 39px of tail slack. A tighter phrasing was
             available at 751/749 and rejected, since 19px is one font
             substitution away from wrapping again. Re-measure before changing a
             word here: the size sentence below was appended after that tuning
             and re-wrapped the paragraph, so the two-line figure applies to the
             first two sentences only.

             The size fact used to be its own paragraph above this one ("All of
             it in 43 KB gzipped, client router included, with zero runtime
             dependencies. A minimal Next.js client bundle is around 99 KB"),
             which read as a stat sitting next to an unrelated claim. It is one
             paragraph now, but NOT one argument: an earlier merge tried "that
             is why it fits in 43 KB", and inventing little does not cause a
             bundle size any more than it causes transferability. Two facts, two
             sentences, no causal frame between them.

             The 99 KB comparison stays because 43 KB means nothing without it.
             "Zero runtime dependencies" was dropped for length and is the thing
             to restore first if this ever gets more room. -->

            architecture stays decided either way, carried in a skill your agent
            reads on demand.

        <!-- THREE artifacts telling one arc: what arrives, what clearing leaves,
             and the shape that survives both. This section used to be two (a
             "Read the demos. Then delete them." section sat above it) and they
             were merged.

             The lede was 115 words, the longest on the page, and the merge is
             why: two windows did not survive it (the webjs ui add terminal and
             the design tokens) so their content was moved into the prose. The
             cards have since been rebuilt and both are back, in "How the UI is
             built". The sentence outlived its reason, and by then it was reading
             out the card headings: "where a feature's code goes" IS the second
             card, "how the palette is declared, and how a component arrives" IS
             the third. It is gone. Before adding prose here, check whether a
             card already shows it, because a window beats a clause every time.

             The payoff sentence went the same way, for the same reason one level
             up: "It starts on your feature instead of on the scaffolding" is what
             the H2 above already says, three inches away, and a scroller reads
             the heading rather than the fourth clause of a paragraph. Check the
             HEADER too, not just the cards.

             63 words now, from 115. That is close to the floor: what is left is
             four facts carried once each (the demos exist, one command removes
             them, the architecture is decided and lives in a skill, the source is
             readable). Cutting further costs content rather than duplication.

             What the lede must keep carrying is the LAST sentence, the framework
             source readable in node_modules. That is the one claim in this
             section no card illustrates, and grepping the page shows this is its
             only mention anywhere.

             Every one of these is COPIED FROM A REAL SCAFFOLDED APP, not
             composed for the page. Verified by running webjs create then
             npm run gallery:clear: 26 routes under app/features before,
             "Gallery cleared (44 paths removed)" as the actual stdout, and the
             module paths from the generated tree. Re-generate and re-run before
             editing any of them. The 26 and the 44 go stale quietly, and a
             plausible-looking invented path is exactly what a reader tries once.

             template body closes the literal at JS-parse time, comment or not.
             This comment had two and took the page down until tsc caught it.

             And exactly ONE closing marker, at the very end. Appending a
             paragraph to a comment this long, it is easy to close it where your
             new text stops, which ends the comment mid-block and renders
             everything after it as visible page text. That shipped once. Note
             the closing marker cannot be written out even here, since typing it
             inside a comment is the very thing being warned about, so count the
             markers instead: openers and closers must be equal in this file.
             Neither tsc nor webjs check can see the mistake, because a
             prematurely closed comment is still valid TS and valid HTML. The
             only detector is looking at the page.) -->

    <!-- Sits HERE, after the scaffold section, because its first sentence picks
         up that section's demos and skill. It was drafted for the slot after
         "What you write is what runs", where it chains off the no-build
         decision instead, and that reads well until you notice the lede would
         be naming
         a ladder (demos, then skill, then source) the reader has not climbed
         yet. The trigger decides the slot.

         This is the readable half of the deleted "Light enough for AI" section,
         which sold two things: that the framework is small and that it is
         readable. The size half was the STATS grid whose numbers turned out to
         be wrong (a 29 KB bundle that measured 43, a 16k line count that
         measured 23,465 in core alone), so it stayed deleted. The readability
         half survived as one trailing clause in the scaffold lede, which is
         where it sat until now.

         The claim is about LOCATION, not availability. Every framework's source
         is on GitHub; this one's is in the working directory your agent is
         already in, at the version actually installed. Do not write "no other
         framework ships its source", which is false, or "no bundle stands
         between the agent and the code", which is false here too: core ships
         dist/webjs-core-browser.js and the export map resolves there by
         default. The section stays silent about that rather than asserting
         its opposite, which is the difference between an omission and a false
         claim. If a future edit does mention it, note that CORE is the only
         package with a dist: server, mcp and ui publish src alone, and cli
         publishes bin plus lib. Verified from each package.json files
         array. -->

            A scaffolded app answers most questions with its demos and its agent
            skill. When those run out, your agent opens the framework itself. It
            reads the router or the renderer it is actually calling straight from
            node_modules, not a version recalled from training data. The files
            you write ship as written, and so do the framework's, so what it
            reads is what is running.

        <!-- TWO windows, one per package, because the claim is about the
             framework rather than about core. They also fix a real gap: one
             window at 1024px held 596px of code and 400px of air.

             12px, not the 14px every other window on this page uses, and the
             grid is the full max-w-6xl rather than the 1024px the other code
             grids share. Both are forced by the content. These excerpts are
             VERBATIM framework source, so they cannot be rewrapped the way a
             hand-written sample can, and this codebase runs to 78 columns at
             p90. A 1024px two-up holds 56 columns at 14px and 66 at 12px;
             1152px holds 74 at 12px. That is the first combination that fits
             real source with slack, and the excerpts were then picked at 69
             columns or under. Change any one of the three (grid width, font
             size, excerpt) and re-measure the other two. -->

             keeps a dist, for the browser. The source sits next to it", and
             the whole of its second half existed to handle that one exception.
             Dropping it is an omission, not a false claim: nothing in this
             section says a build output does not exist, and the windows show
             src paths rather than asserting anything about dist.

             It points at @webjsdev rather than @webjsdev/core/src because the
             two windows above are core AND server, and because the readable
             folder is src in most packages but lib in the CLI, so the scope
             above them is the one address that is right everywhere.

             What went with the merge is the second half of the dare, "then open
             the same folder for whatever you shipped last". That was doing real
             work, in the register the JavaScript-off P.S. established: a claim
             the reader confirms beats one they accept. If it comes back, it
             needs to name the folder and the action ("then try to read the
             framework in your last project's node_modules"), because "the same
             folder" pointed at a path that exists in no other app. -->
