/**
 * Root layout for the redesigned marketing site.
 *
 * Styling is Tailwind-first: chrome and structure use utility classes,
 * with the design tokens declared once in the foundation <style> below
 * and exposed to Tailwind via @theme in public/input.css. Only the
 * genuinely un-utility-expressible pieces stay as CSS: the prefers-reduced-motion
 * clamp, the fixed static glow layer, the hover-only scrollbar (`.scroll-thin`),
 * and the <details> icon swap. Everything else is Tailwind.
 *
 * Shared link config (DOCS_START_PATH / UI_PATH / GH_URL / NEW_TAB) lives in
 * lib/links.ts, imported here and by app/page.ts.

// The title carries the CATEGORY, because that is what people type. The old
// one named neither "web components" nor "build step", so the phrase this
// whole site is built around matched nothing in the strongest on-page signal
// there is. The H1 stays the positioning claim: it is a minor ranking signal
// and the only line that differentiates us, and the definition sentence sits
// in bold directly beneath it either way. 56 characters, inside the SERP
// truncation limit, brand first. The separator is a spaced hyphen, by the
// owner's call: a colon reads as a label in a browser tab that shows about
// twenty characters. That is a deliberate exception to invariant 11 for page
// titles only, so do not "fix" it back to a colon. The Articles and Compare
// page titles follow the same rule.
const TITLE = 'WebJs - Full-stack web components framework, no build step';
// 155 characters, against 256 before. Google renders about 160, so a third of
// the old one was never shown to anyone.
//
// It also carried a false claim: "Lean enough for AI agents to read end to
// end". packages/core/src alone is 23,465 lines and core plus server is
// 50,511, so nothing reads it end to end and none of it "fits in context".
// That sentence outlived the "Light enough for AI" section it was written for,
// because a section gets reviewed and metadata does not, and it was live in
// every search result.
//
// The true version of that idea is about LOCATION, not volume: the source sits
// in the app's own node_modules at the installed version, so an agent opens
// the file it needs instead of recalling an API from training data.

    // a page was NEVER reusable from disk, so every view paid a round trip even

    // browser cache hits (back/forward, repeat visits, a second tab) while
    // bounding how long a reader can hold pre-deploy HTML to one minute.

    // the first usable icon and wants a SQUARE raster whose side is a multiple
    // of 48px. This once declared sizes="32x32" on an asset that is really
    // 512x512: the claim was both wrong and under Google's 48px floor, which is
    // why webjs.dev showed no icon in search results. 192 is used because it is
    // a clean multiple of 48 (512 is not, 512 % 48 = 32).
    //
    // Declared here rather than hand-written into the shell below, which is the
    // way the framework documents and the way every other app in the repo does
    // it. A hand-written tag only works because this is the ROOT layout, the
    // one layout allowed to write a shell at all (invariant 8), so it was a
    // pattern no other layout could copy.
    //
    // /favicon.ico is absent on purpose: it is served from public/favicon.ico
    // at the origin root and stays the fallback for crawlers that read no
    // markup, so linking it would add a tag nothing reads.
