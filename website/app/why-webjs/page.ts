/**
 * /why-webjs
 *
 * The developer pitch page. Where the home page shows the framework's shape
 * (progressive enhancement, the three-file stack, the weight stats), this page
 * makes the single argument that matters most for the AI era: an agent reads the
 * framework source it is calling, from the app's own node_modules at the version
 * installed there, so it needs no training data and no single blessed model to
 * build a WebJs app well. The claim is about LOCATION, not volume. Nothing reads
 * the whole framework (see the comment above DESCRIPTION in app/layout.ts for
 * the line counts), and the located version is the stronger claim anyway,
 * because it holds however large the framework grows.
 *
 * It deliberately reuses the home page's design language (the KICKER label, the
 * section rhythm, the terminal "windows", the bento grid, and the closing CTA
 * card) so the site reads as one system. The prose stays honest: it sells the
 * capability on its own terms, never by talking down the alternatives.

            Most frameworks leave the big decisions open, and that flexibility
            is the point of them. But an open decision has to be closed by
            somebody, and when an agent is writing the code, that somebody is
            whoever wrote the prompt. So the request grows an appendix of
            technical instructions, and every one of them is a thing you had to
            know to ask for. WebJs has already made those calls, so the request
            stays the request.

            Opinionated is the point, and none of it is a cage. Light DOM
            components, Tailwind, and Drizzle on SQLite are what a scaffolded app
            starts with, because something has to be chosen and leaving it open
            is what pushed the decision into your prompt. Reach for a different
            ORM, a different database, or a different way of styling and the
            framework does not object. What you are opting out of is a default,
            never a dependency the rest of it is built on.

            Because the framework itself is the context, you are not locked to
            the one model that happened to memorize a given API. Point a large
            model or a small one at a WebJs project and it fits the source into
            context and gets to work. Switch models between tasks and the output
            stays reliable, because they are all reading the same readable code.

          <p class="text-fg-muted text-base leading-[1.6] m-0 mb-4">
            That shows up in the quality of what comes back, not only in whether
            a model can participate. Routing, the server boundary, and the file
            layout are settled by convention, and the palette lives in design
            tokens the root layout sets once, so a smaller model is filling
            those in rather than inventing them. Taste is still yours to
            direct, and you still read what an agent hands you. What you stop
            doing is re-deciding the shape of the app every time you switch.

            Human developers get the same deal. There is no hidden compiler
            output to reverse engineer when something breaks. You open the file,
            read the JavaScript, and see exactly what ran.
