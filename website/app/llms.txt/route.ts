/**
 * GET /llms.txt
 *
 * A machine-readable overview of WebJs for LLMs and AI coding agents,
 * following the llmstxt.org convention (an H1 name, a `>` blockquote
 * summary, free-form detail, then `##` link sections, with a trailing
 * `## Optional` for links a shorter context may skip). On-brand for an
 * AI-first framework: the same agents the framework is built for get a
 * canonical, curated entry point instead of scraping the rendered HTML.
 *
 * A route handler (not a metadata route) because `/llms.txt` is not one
 * of the framework's metadata stems. It is server-only, so it imports the
 * content queries directly and lists every live article + comparison, the
 * blog hub plus recent posts, and the key project entry points (repo, the
 * agent-facing AGENTS.md contract, docs, UI kit, demo).
 *
 * `SITE_URL` mirrors app/sitemap.ts and app/robots.ts so all three agree
 * on the origin. The cross-app URLs (UI, demo, repo) are the shared single
 * source from lib/links.ts, the same ones the header/footer use.
 *
 * The documentation now lives on THIS origin under /docs, so it is
 * enumerated inline (every page, with its description) rather than reduced
 * to a single link at another host. This is the one llms.txt for the site.

It works with any assistant through one cross-agent contract, and scaffolds a production-shaped app from the first command.',

A short brief in the scaffold AGENTS.md and a richly commented scaffold layer on curated context. The API is Lit-like for familiarity, but ships its own implementation and differs in places, which does not matter because the source is the context.',
