/**
 * /what-is-webjs
 *
 * The definitional page for the "what is webjs" query class. Where /why-webjs makes
 * the argument for the framework and /compare positions it against specific
 * alternatives, this page answers the flat question: what IS this thing.
 *
 * It exists because the query is contested. "WebJS" also names a dormant Java
 * web framework (last published 2013), a small client-side toolkit, and it is
 * the common short form of whatsapp-web.js. So the page leads with an
 * unambiguous one-sentence definition, then disambiguates the other projects by
 * name in a dedicated section. That section is the honest answer to a real
 * reader question and is what makes this page a better result than a stub that
 * only describes our own framework.
 *
 * SEO shape, deliberately:
 *  - exact-match <title>, <h1>, and URL slug for the target query
 *  - a definition in the first 160 characters, so the meta description and the
 *    opening paragraph both stand alone as an answer snippet
 *  - a visible FAQ that is the SAME source as the FAQPage JSON-LD (via
 *    lib/utils/faq.ts), because Google discounts schema not present on the page
 *  - SoftwareApplication + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage structured data
 *  - alternates.canonical, since this page is the one canonical definition
 *
 * Reuses the home page's design language (the shared lib/design/recipes.ts recipes, the terminal
 * "windows", the bento CARD) so the site reads as one system.

const FAQ = [
  {
    question: 'What is WebJs?',
    answer:
      'WebJs is a full-stack JavaScript web framework built on web components. It server-renders every page and component to real HTML, needs no build step or bundler, and runs on Node 24+ or Bun. The framework serves your source to the browser exactly as you wrote it, so the code you read is the code that runs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What makes WebJs AI-first?',
    answer:
      'WebJs is designed so a coding agent can change one part of an app without reading all of it. File conventions are predictable, each server function lives in its own file, and the .server.ts extension marks the server boundary explicitly, so the relevant context for a change is small and easy to locate. Every app ships an AGENTS.md contract plus a cross-agent skill that Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, and opencode all read from one source. And because there is no build step, the framework itself sits as plain JavaScript with JSDoc in node_modules/@webjsdev of every app, so an agent reads the actual router, renderer, or serializer it is calling rather than a compiled bundle. That grounding in real source is what lets even smaller AI models produce quality WebJs code.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is WebJs free to use?',
    answer:
      'Yes. WebJs is free and open source under the MIT license, developed in the open at github.com/webjsdev/webjs. There is no paid tier, no license key, and no hosted service you are required to buy.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is WebJs the same as whatsapp-web.js?',
    answer:
      'No. whatsapp-web.js is an unofficial Node.js library for building WhatsApp clients and bots, often shortened to wwebjs. WebJs is an unrelated full-stack web framework for building websites and web applications.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is WebJs the same as the older Java WebJS framework?',
    answer:
      'No. An earlier unrelated project called WebJS aimed to let Java developers build web applications, and it was last published in 2013. WebJs is a modern JavaScript and TypeScript framework, actively developed, with no connection to that project.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does WebJs need a build step?',
    answer:
      'No. WebJs serves your source files directly as native ES modules. TypeScript is stripped at request time by the runtime, using Node 24+ built-in type stripping or amaro on Bun, so there is no bundler, no compile output, and no watch process to keep in sync. You edit a file and refresh.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does a WebJs app work without JavaScript?',
    answer:
      'Yes, for everything that does not require interactivity. Pages and components are server-rendered to HTML, so content reads, links navigate, and forms submit with JavaScript disabled. Scripts are then layered on per interactive behaviour rather than per component, and a display-only component ships no JavaScript at all.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What can you build with WebJs?',
    answer:
      'Full-stack web applications with server-rendered pages, file-based routing, server actions, sessions, authentication, caching, rate limiting, WebSockets, and a database layer. It also runs backend-only as an HTTP and JSON API framework if you skip pages entirely.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is WebJs tied to Tailwind and Drizzle?',
    answer:
      'No. A scaffolded app arrives wired to Tailwind for styling, Drizzle with SQLite for data, light DOM components, and design tokens, because an agent building your app should not have to stop and ask. Those are defaults rather than requirements. Bring a different ORM, a different database, or a different way of styling and the framework does not object, since none of the routing, rendering, or server-action machinery depends on any of them.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does WebJs give you full-stack type safety?',
    answer:
      'Yes, and without a code generation step. A component imports a server action through an ordinary import, so the call site keeps that function\'s real argument and return types, and a database row carries its schema type from Drizzle through the action into the markup that renders it. Because types are stripped at request time rather than compiled, the types you read in the editor describe the code that actually runs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you install WebJs?',
    answer:
      'Run npm create webjs@latest my-app to scaffold a full-stack application, then npm run dev to start it. The scaffold includes routing, a database layer, and a styled layout, so the app is production-shaped from the first command.',
