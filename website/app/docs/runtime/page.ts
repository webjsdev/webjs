    <h1>Runtime</h1>
    <p>WebJs runs on <strong>Node 24+</strong> or <strong>Bun</strong>. The same app source runs on either; the framework picks a runtime-neutral path internally and only the listener shell, the type stripper, and a few built-ins differ. Deno is a planned target (the listener seam is already runtime-neutral), not yet supported. This page is the single reference for the per-runtime commands and differences; other pages link here rather than repeat them.</p>

    <p>The in-place dev refresh needs the server process to <strong>survive</strong> the edit, which is the whole of that last row. A page or layout never hydrates, so a freshly rendered page is the complete truth for it and the client router can swap it in without a reload, keeping your scroll position and the hydrated state of components outside the changed region. The server classifies the changed file and puts the verdict on the live-reload event, so it needs a process that is still alive to do the classifying.</p>
    <p>Bun's <code>bun --hot</code> invalidates modules in place without restarting, so it gets the refresh. It cannot reload a module that a Bun plugin serves, though: every <code>'use server'</code> <code>*.server.*</code> module, and with dev source locations on (<code>WEBJS_SOURCE_LOCATIONS=1</code>) every app module. The supervisor restarts the server for an edit to one of those, so on Bun with source locations on every app edit is a full reload, as on Node. On Node, the <code>webjs dev</code> supervisor restarts the server process on a change under <code>app</code>, <code>components</code>, <code>modules</code>, <code>lib</code>, or <code>actions</code>, or to a root <code>middleware</code> file, and a fresh process holds no record of what changed, so those edits are a full reload. Two Node cases still refresh in place: an edit outside that watched set (<code>db/schema.server.ts</code>, a <code>webjs.dev.watch</code> content directory), and <code>npm run dev -- --no-hot</code>, which keeps the server in one process on either runtime. A component edit is a full reload everywhere by design, because <code>customElements.define</code> is once-per-tag and swapping fresh markup onto the old class would be worse than the reload.</p>

    <p>The supervisor is part of <code>webjs dev</code> itself (it replaced <code>node --watch</code>), and it is built so the preview does not stay down. A file in a watched directory that the dev server cannot read or watch (for example the temporary file <code>sed -i</code> creates when another user runs it, or a file deleted while it was being watched) logs one <code>file watcher skipped</code> warning, and the server keeps serving and reloading. If the server process crashes, the supervisor starts it again on the next file change, or by itself after a short wait (0.5s, then up to 10s for repeated crashes). On Bun the same supervisor brings a crashed server back and restarts it for the edits <code>bun --hot</code> cannot reload, and <code>bun --hot</code> handles the rest.</p>

    <p>Either way the <code>.ts</code> stripping is position-preserving with no sourcemap, and the bytes the browser fetches are identical. The 103 Early Hints gap only costs a small first-load latency edge where your edge forwards 103, never correctness (the modulepreload hints still ship in the document head).</p>

    <h2>Node (the default)</h2>
    <p>Scaffold with <code>webjs create my-app</code> (Node is the default runtime). Then:</p>
    <code-block>npm install
npm run dev      # or: npm run start</code-block>
    <p>Node 24+ is required: the built-in TypeScript stripper (<code>module.stripTypeScriptTypes</code>, stable from Node 24) and recursive <code>fs.watch</code> need it. The CLI's <code>assertNodeVersion()</code> preflight enforces the floor.</p>

    <h2>Bun</h2>
    <p>Scaffold with <code>webjs create my-app --runtime bun</code>, or <code>bun create webjs my-app</code> (the runtime is auto-detected from the invoking package manager). Then:</p>
    <code-block>bun install
bun run dev      # or: bun run start</code-block>
    <p>A Bun app installs with <code>bun install</code> (like Node), then runs on Bun: its <code>dev</code> / <code>start</code> / <code>db</code> scripts force <code>bun --bun</code>, which overrides the <code>webjs</code> bin's Node shebang so the server runs on Bun, where it selects the native <code>Bun.serve</code> listener and strips types via <code>amaro</code>. The dependencies resolve from <code>node_modules</code>, the same as Node.</p>
    <p>The install also gives editor type intelligence (the editor reads the <code>.d.ts</code> files in <code>node_modules</code>).</p>

    <h3>Install model and reproducibility</h3>
    <p>A Bun app commits a <code>bun.lock</code> (the Bun analog of <code>package-lock.json</code>) for reproducible, offline installs. The scaffold's Bun Dockerfile runs <code>bun install</code> and serves on Bun via <code>CMD ["bun", "--bun", "run", "start"]</code>.</p>

    <h2>Future runtimes</h2>
    <p>The server's listener selection is a runtime-neutral seam: <code>startServer</code> chooses the <code>Bun.serve</code> shell on Bun and the <code>node:http</code> shell on Node through the same seam, which is designed to also host a <code>Deno.serve</code> or an embedded adapter later. When Deno support lands it will appear here. Edge runtimes with no filesystem are a separate, later target.</p>
