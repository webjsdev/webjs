/**
 * The accessibility rules every code block on the site follows.
 *
 * Three rules, each checkable from the rendered markup alone:
 *
 *  1. A named block carries `role="region"`. A <pre> maps to ARIA role
 *     `generic`, and ARIA prohibits an author-supplied name on `generic`, so a
 *     bare <pre aria-label="..."> hands a spec-following screen reader a name
 *     it will not announce.
 *  2. No two blocks on a page share a name. A named region is a landmark, and
 *     duplicates collapse into an ambiguous pair in the landmark list.
 *  3. A block that can scroll carries `tabindex="0"`. It is a scroll container
 *     at some viewport width, and a scroll container no keyboard can reach is
 *     unusable without a pointer.
 *
 * This lives in its own file, and loops over pages, because the rules belong
 * to the site rather than to any one page. Coverage is not a hand-kept list:
 * the documentation and gallery pages are discovered from the file system, and
 * every gallery detail page comes from the registry index the sidebar is built
 * from, so a page or a component added tomorrow is checked without anyone
 * remembering to add it here. Six entries ARE listed by hand, because they have
 * no directory to walk: the three marketing pages, the error boundary, the
 * gallery introduction at /ui, and the markdown post body that /blog/[slug],
 * /articles/[slug], and /compare/[slug] all share.
 *
 * Pages are rendered THROUGH their layout, not alone. That is what makes rule
 * 3 real rather than vacuous: a docs block scrolls because of the shell's
 * `.prose-docs pre { overflow-x: auto }` rule, not because of a utility class
 * on the tag, so a detector that only reads the class would pass every docs
 * page while every block on it was still unreachable by keyboard.
