/**
 * What the SERVER emits for a <code-block>, which is the whole no-JS reading
 * path and the first paint for every code sample under /docs and /ui.
 *
 * The component renders a `<slot>` at SSR (`connectedCallback` is a
 * browser-only hook, so the token branch never runs there) and the framework
 * projects the authored code into it as text. Nothing else asserts that. The
 * browser tests start from a hand-written fixture of this shape rather than
 * from the server's real output, and the a11y test reads only `<pre …>` open
 * tags, so if light-DOM projection ever dropped the children, every one of
 * those suites would still pass while every code sample on the docs site
 * rendered blank without JavaScript.

/*
 * The browser suite mounts a hand-written copy of the server's output, because
 * `renderToString` does not exist in the browser. That copy is only useful
 * while it is accurate: the runtime picks its light-DOM adoption branch on the
 * hydrate marker and its slot adoption on `data-webjs-light` together with
 * `data-projection`, so a fixture that drifts on any of them silently reroutes
 * the whole browser suite onto the client-first-mount path that no production
 * page takes, and every test there keeps passing.
 *
 * This is the guard for that, and it lives here because this is where the real
 * renderer runs. An earlier attempt asserted the markers from inside the
 * browser test instead, which could not work: the runtime sets `data-wj-host`
 * on every light-DOM connect regardless of branch, and the component resolves
 * its text before the base hook either way, so both paths leave identical DOM.
 * Nothing observable in the browser distinguishes them. Comparing bytes here
 * does.
