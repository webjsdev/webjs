/**
 * The docs share the marketing site's chrome (#1098).
 *
 * The docs used to live on docs.webjs.dev with their own root layout, nav,
 * footer, and design tokens. Moving them to webjs.dev/docs is only half the
 * point; the other half is that they now render inside the SAME shell every
 * other page uses, so a reader crossing from /what-is-webjs into /docs does
 * not leave one design system and enter another.
 *
 * Nothing about that is self-enforcing. Someone can reintroduce a docs-only
 * header, a second theme toggle, or a duplicate `@theme` block and the pages
 * will still render fine, just as two subtly different sites again. These
 * assertions are what make that regression fail instead of ship.
 *
 * Asserted against the REAL request pipeline rather than the layout function
 * in isolation, because "the docs page ends up wrapped in the root layout" is
 * exactly the property under test, and calling DocsLayout directly would
 * assume it.
