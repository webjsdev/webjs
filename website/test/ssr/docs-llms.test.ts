/**
 * The llms.txt corpus keeps the docs' code samples fenced.
 *
 * `lib/docs-llms.server.ts` builds `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, and every
 * `/docs/<topic>/llms.txt` by parsing each page's SOURCE, so it has to know
 * which tag the samples are written in. When they moved from `<pre>` to
 * `<code-block>` and this was not updated, nothing failed: a sample does not
 * disappear, it falls through to the prose pipeline, which strips the fence,
 * eats every `${...}` hole in the code, and collapses the indentation. The
 * output stayed plausible and every sample in it stopped being usable, which
 * is exactly the failure a test has to catch instead of a reader.
 *
 * The docs search index is built from this same markdown
 * (`app/api/search/route.ts`), so it inherits whatever this produces. Its
 * heading extraction now tracks fences (`lib/utils/doc-headings.ts`), using
 * the same fence predicate this module's normalisation pass uses, so a
 * line-leading `# ` shell comment inside a sample is not scored as a
 * heading. That behaviour is covered by `test/lib/doc-headings.test.ts` and
 * `test/ssr/docs-search.test.ts`, not here.
