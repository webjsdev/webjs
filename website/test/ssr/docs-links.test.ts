 * the per-page markdown routes are full-text copies of pages that also exist
 * as HTML, which is exactly the near-duplicate problem the move is meant to
 * end rather than reproduce.
 *
 * The link check found three real 404s that had been shipping on
 * docs.webjs.dev (`/docs/route-handlers`, `/docs/caching`, `/docs/advanced`,
 * none of which are real slugs), so it is a guard worth having rather than a
