/**
 * SSR smoke test for the /why-webjs pitch page (app/why-webjs/page.ts).
 *
 * The page is pure marketing markup (no components of its own), so this guards
 * the things that would only otherwise surface at dogfood boot: a render crash,
 * a malformed html`` template, a stray-backtick (invariant 9) regression, a
 * dropped install command, or the missing main landmark. It also pins the
 * page's own metadata as self-consistent across the title, og, and twitter tags
 * and pointed at the dedicated /why-webjs social card.
