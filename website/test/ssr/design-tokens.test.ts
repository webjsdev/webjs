/**
 * Pins lib/design/tokens.ts to the custom properties app/layout.ts actually
 * declares. The brand page paints its palette chips straight from tokens.ts,
 * beside real components painted from the layout's tokens, so any divergence
 * between the two files is a live visual defect on /brand: two different
 * colours presented as the same token. Review round 1 found exactly that
 * (three drifted ACCENTS values); this test is what makes the next drift a
 * red build instead of a silent lie.
 *
 * It ALSO pins the shape the layout declares them in. Each per-theme colour is
 * one light-dark(LIGHT, DARK) declaration, which is the rule the framework
 * teaches its own users (/docs/styling) and which the site
 * itself did not follow until #1216: the dark half used to be written twice,
 * once under the OS media query and once under the toggle's attribute, so an
 * edit to either copy drifted the two paths apart with nothing to catch it.
 * Both halves of this file matter, since a duplicated block would still let
 * the value assertions below pass.
