/**
 * The landing page used to carry an intro video, first as a YouTube iframe and
 * then (#1440) as a native player pointed at videos.webjs.dev. It is gone.
 *
 * The bytes are still in the R2 bucket `webjs-videos`, so restoring the section
 * is an editorial call rather than a re-upload. What these assertions pin is
 * that it does not come back by accident: an embed added to any of the shared
 * section helpers would land on this page without anyone editing it here.
 *
 * The copy assertions cover the one-line definition of WebJs, which is
 * duplicated across the visible lede, the meta description, and the OG-image
 * generator. Pinning the rendered wording is what catches a partial edit that
 * leaves the search snippet contradicting the page.
