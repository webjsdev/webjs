/**
 * Unit tests for the docs search index's heading extraction
 * (lib/utils/doc-headings.ts).
 *
 * The extractor exists because the docs corpus is full of code samples that
 * open a line with `#`: a shell comment, or a JavaScript private class
 * field. Scored as headings they earn +5 each in `app/api/search/route.ts`,
 * accumulating per match, which is how a query for `localhost` ranked
 * /docs/backend-only at 16 off three `# → http://localhost:8080` comments.
 *
 * Two levels of coverage here, on purpose. The fixture pins the rule in
 * isolation, and the corpus test pins that the rule still holds against the
 * real docs, where the samples that motivated it actually live.
