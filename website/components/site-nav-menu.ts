/**
 * `<site-nav-menu>`: the header's mobile navigation menu.
 *
 * Wraps a native `<details>`, and that choice is the whole progressive
 * enhancement story. With JavaScript off the summary still opens and closes the
 * panel, because that is what `<details>` does. This component adds only the
 * three dismissals a bare `<details>` has no opinion about: a click outside it,
 * a click on one of its links, and Escape.
 *
 * So the component never drives the open state on the way IN. It ABSORBS what
 * the browser already did, through `@toggle`, and only writes the state on the
 * way out when something should dismiss the menu. Taking the interaction over
 * (preventDefault on the summary, drive `open` from a click handler) would work
 * with JS and break without it, for no gain.
 *
 * Two consequences of letting the browser drive, both load-bearing:
 *
 *   - `toggle` is fired ASYNCHRONOUSLY, so there is a window after a summary
 *     click where the details is open and `this.open` is still false. Nothing
 *     renders in that window in practice, but it is why a test cannot assert
 *     the component's state on the microtask right after the click.
 *   - the browser mutating `open` behind the renderer leaves the renderer's
 *     cached value stale, so a later write of the value it last rendered gets
 *     skipped as a no-op and the menu never closes. `live()` is the directive
 *     for exactly that, comparing against the DOM rather than the cache.
 *
 * The links are slotted, so the header keeps its NAV data in app/layout.ts and
 * this file keeps the chrome and the behaviour.
