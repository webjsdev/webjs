/**
 * `<docs-drawer>`: the sidebar shell shared by /docs and /ui, and the mobile
 * drawer it collapses into under 900px.
 *
 * This owns the whole feature: the backdrop, the toggle button, the aside
 * column, the open state, and every listener that can close it. That is the
 * point of it existing. The behaviour used to live in a delegated listener in
 * the ROOT layout while the markup lived in lib/ui/docs-shell.ts, coupled only
 * by a `.docs-nav-toggle` class selector, and every bug the tests pin came out
 * of that split: a backdrop dismiss that left `aria-expanded` reading true
 * forever, an Escape that did not close, both nav surfaces open at once.
 *
 * `aria-expanded` is a hole bound to `this.open`, so no second place holds it
 * and the two cannot drift apart in normal operation. The one window where they
 * do differ is between a synchronous close and the render that commits the
 * hole, which matters solely because the back/forward snapshot is read inside
 * exactly that window. `_onBeforeCache` below is the whole reason that window
 * is worth knowing about.
 *
 * Layout note. The toggle renders inside <main>, not inside the <aside>, and
 * that is load-bearing rather than incidental: under 900px the aside is a
 * fixed, off-canvas, `visibility: hidden` panel, so a button rendered inside it
 * would be unreachable exactly when it is needed. Both still belong to this
 * component; only their positions in the template differ.
 *
 * Progressive enhancement: with JavaScript off the drawer cannot open, which
 * is exactly what the delegated-listener version did. The sidebar is still in
 * the DOM and still reads on a wide viewport. Making the drawer work without
 * JS is a real gap and is tracked separately.
