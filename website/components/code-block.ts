/**
 * `<code-block>` is the one code sample on this site. It owns the `<pre>`
 * markup (the keyboard focus stop, the optional landmark name) and the
 * client-side pass that colors the documentation's samples.
 *
 * Usage, light DOM, the code as plain text children:
 *
 *   <code-block>npm create webjs@latest my-app</code-block>
 *   <code-block label="root layout">export default function Layout() {}</code-block>
 *
 * Why the `<pre>` lives here rather than at each of the ~480 call sites: both
 * of the attributes that matter are easy to forget and invisible when missing.
 * A `<pre>` that scrolls horizontally with no `tabindex` can only be scrolled
 * with a pointer, which is axe's scrollable-region-focusable and unusable for
 * a keyboard or switch user, and the docs shell makes every `<pre>` under
 * `.prose-docs` a scroll container. Declaring the markup once is what stops
 * that drifting back one page at a time.
 *
 * `label` is optional and usually omitted. A named block also takes
 * `role="region"`, because a `<pre>` maps to ARIA role `generic` and ARIA
 * prohibits an author-supplied name there, so a bare `aria-label` is a name a
 * spec-following screen reader will not announce. A named region is also a
 * landmark, so two blocks on one page must not share a name. A block with no
 * genuinely distinct name takes the focus stop alone, which is valid, and
 * that is why most callers pass nothing.
 *
 * Highlighting. The documentation's samples are authored as inline template
 * text (with `&lt;` and `&#123;` escapes, since a raw `<` would open a tag
 * and a raw `${` would open a hole), not as JS strings, so the server has no
 * string to tokenize and the coloring has to happen in the browser. That is
 * what `connectedCallback` does: it reads the block's text once, before the
 * first client render replaces the light DOM, and renders tokens from it.
 * The grammar is imported from lib/utils/highlight.ts, the same one the
 * marketing pages and the blog renderer use at SSR, so the palette matches
 * everywhere and there is no second copy to keep in sync.
 *
 * At SSR `connectedCallback` never runs (it is a browser-only hook), so the
 * server renders the `<slot>` branch and the code is projected into the
 * `<pre>` as plain text. That is the no-JS reading path, and it is also the
 * first paint: the color arrives on upgrade, the content never does.
 *
 * There is no MutationObserver and no `data-hl` guard, which is the point of
 * being an element rather than a script. A custom element upgrades whenever
 * its tag enters the DOM, so a hard load, a soft navigation into the docs,
 * and a soft navigation between two docs pages are all the same event, with
 * no site-wide observer left running on the marketing pages to catch them.
