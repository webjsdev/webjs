# AGENTS.md for the landing site

The webjs marketing / landing site, built on webjs itself. All
framework-wide rules (file conventions, public API, workflow, scaffold
rules, persistence rules, autonomous-mode behaviour) live in the
**framework root [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)** and apply here. Read
that first.

This file only covers what's specific to the landing site.

## Layout

```
website/
  app/
    layout.ts          root layout (head, OG/Twitter metadata,
                       header/footer chrome, Tailwind tokens)
    page.ts            /  → the entire one-page landing site.
                           Hero, features grid, code samples, agent
                           badges, and footer all live here.
    changelog/page.ts  /changelog. Reads ../../../changelog/<pkg>/*.md
                       at SSR time and renders the unified release
                       feed. The deployment image must include the
                       changelog/ tree at the repo root, the
                       Dockerfile's `COPY changelog ./changelog` line
                       is what ships it on Railway.
    blog/              /blog hub + /blog/[slug]. Reads ../../../blog/*.md.
                       WebJs design notes (dated). Emits per-post JSON-LD
                       (BlogPosting + BreadcrumbList). No FAQ.
    articles/          /articles hub + /articles/[slug]. Reads
                       ../../../articles/*.md. Evergreen keyword explainers
                       (tags, no dates). Emits TechArticle + BreadcrumbList
                       + FAQPage.
    compare/           /compare hub + /compare/[slug]. Reads
                       ../../../compare/*.md. Emits per-page JSON-LD
                       (TechArticle + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage).
    sitemap.ts         /sitemap.xml (enumerates articles + compare + blog)
    robots.ts          /robots.txt (allow-all, points at the sitemap)
    llms.txt/route.ts  /llms.txt (llmstxt.org overview for AI agents)
  components/
    theme-toggle.ts    system/light/dark cycle
    copy-cmd.ts        click-to-copy command line (light DOM, always-on button)
  lib/
    highlight.ts       SSR syntax highlighter for the code samples
    frontmatter.ts     parse changelog/blog markdown frontmatter
    faq.ts             parse a `## FAQ` markdown section into FAQPage JSON-LD
  scripts/             manual dev tools, NOT part of build/deploy
    fetch-fonts.mjs    download the self-hosted variable woff2 fonts
    generate-og.mjs    regenerate the OG social card (needs playwright + ImageMagick)
  public/              favicon, og image, self-hosted fonts, static assets
```

The site is intentionally one page in long-form scroll. When you edit
copy, find the section in `app/page.ts` (search for the visible text
that needs to change) and update inline.

## How to add a feature card

The features grid is driven by the `PILLARS` array near the top of
`app/page.ts`. Each entry is `{ icon, title, desc }`, where `icon` is a
key into the local `ICON` map (for example `ICON.bolt`). Add a new entry
in the correct order and the grid reflows automatically. If no existing
icon fits, add one to the `ICON` map first.

## SEO surfaces (articles, blog, comparisons, structured data)

The site targets real search keywords ("web components framework", "no
build javascript framework", and so on) and "WebJs vs X" queries. Content
is split by editorial intent, which is what decides where a piece goes:

- **`/articles`** is evergreen, keyword-targeted explainers on the web
  platform ("what a web components framework is", "run TypeScript with no
  build step"). Timeless reference, presented WITHOUT dates. An article is
  an `articles/<slug>.md` file. Only write one for a term with real search
  demand where WebJs is a legitimate answer (validate the query first; a
  coined phrase nobody searches does not belong here). Articles carry a
  `## FAQ` (SEO landing pages, like `/compare`).
- **`/blog`** is dated WebJs design notes ("the decisions, the trade-offs,
  the things that did not work"). A `blog/<slug>.md` post, FAQ-free, in
  the author's first-person voice. A general web-platform explainer does
  NOT belong here (that is why the split exists); it goes in `/articles`.
- **`/compare`** is "WebJs vs <framework>" head-to-heads (`compare/<slug>.md`).
- Do NOT let two pages chase the same exact keyword (cannibalization);
  an article owns the general term, a blog post owns the WebJs-specific angle.
- **FAQ convention.** End an article or comparison body with a `## FAQ`
  section, each question a `### <question>` heading followed by its answer
  paragraph. `lib/faq.ts` (`parseFaq`) turns that into a `FAQPage` JSON-LD
  block. The FAQ is BOTH rendered (normal markdown) and emitted as schema,
  so the two never drift (Google discounts FAQ schema that is not visible
  on the page). Blog posts do NOT use FAQ.
- **JSON-LD** is set via `metadata.jsonLd` (the framework emits a
  `<script type="application/ld+json">`): `TechArticle` + `BreadcrumbList`
  + `FAQPage` on articles and comparisons, `BlogPosting` + `BreadcrumbList`
  on blog posts, and `WebSite` + `Organization` + `SoftwareApplication` on
  the home page (jsonLd-only `export const metadata`, so it does not split
  the layout-sourced title). Article schemas carry an `image`. Keep the
  schema honest: it must match the visible page content.
- **`/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/llms.txt`** are generated from the
  live content queries, so a new article, comparison, or post needs no
  edit to those files.

## Announcement banner

The layout (`app/layout.ts`) renders a top-of-page announcement strip
just above the sticky header: a small utility-class `<div>` with a "New"
badge and a link (currently the `UI_URL` link, "Introducing the AI-first
component library"). To swap the announcement, edit that `<div>` (its copy
and the link `href`). The banner shows on every page. Remove the `<div>`
to hide it.

## How to update headline / hero copy

`app/page.ts`: the hero block is at the top of the default-exported
function. Edit the inline `<h1>` / `<p>` text.

## Style

- Light DOM, Tailwind utilities, `@theme` tokens from the root layout
  (same palette / type scale as the blog and docs).
- Each section in `page.ts` is a `<section>` wrapper for predictable
  scroll anchors.

## Run

```sh
cd website && npm run dev       # http://localhost:5001
```

`npm run dev` and `webjs dev` behave identically (#550): `webjs.dev.before`
compiles `public/tailwind.css`, and `webjs.dev.regenerate` (#967) recompiles it
on request when a source changes, so the stylesheet never goes stale without a
live watcher. In prod, `npm start` and `webjs start` are equivalent too:
`webjs.start.before` runs `npm run css:build` before serving.

Set `DOCS_URL` / `UI_URL` / `EXAMPLE_BLOG_URL` env vars to point the header links at
the right hosts when deploying. `EXAMPLE_BLOG_URL` is the live example-blog app
surfaced as the "Demo" link. Locally, `.env` in this directory sets them to
the sibling apps' localhost ports. Blog and Changelog are in-app routes, so
they need no env var.
